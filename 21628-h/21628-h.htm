<h2><a name="MARCELLUS_AND_HANNIBAL" id="MARCELLUS_AND_HANNIBAL"></a>MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL</h2>


<p><i>Hannibal.</i> Could a Numidian horseman ride no faster?
Marcellus! oh! Marcellus! He moves not&mdash;he is dead. Did he
not stir his fingers? Stand wide, soldiers&mdash;wide, forty paces;
give him air; bring water; halt! Gather those broad leaves,
and all the rest, growing under the brushwood; unbrace his
armour. Loose the helmet first&mdash;his breast rises. I fancied
his eyes were fixed on me&mdash;they have rolled back again. Who
presumed to touch my shoulder? This horse? It was surely
the horse of Marcellus! Let no man mount him. Ha! ha!
the Romans, too, sink into luxury: here is gold about the
charger.</p>

<p><i>Gaulish Chieftain.</i> Execrable thief! The golden chain of our
king under a beast&#8217;s grinders! The vengeance of the gods hath
overtaken the impure&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hannibal.</i> We will talk about vengeance when we have entered
Rome, and about purity among the priests, if they will hear us.
Sound for the surgeon. That arrow may be extracted from the
side, deep as it is. The conqueror of Syracuse lies before me.
Send a vessel off to Carthage. Say Hannibal is at the gates of
Rome. Marcellus, who stood alone between us, fallen. Brave
man! I would rejoice and cannot. How awfully serene a
countenance! Such as we hear are in the islands of the Blessed.
And how glorious a form and stature! Such too was theirs!
They also once lay thus upon the earth wet with their blood&mdash;few
other enter there. And what plain armour!</p>

<p><i>Gaulish Chieftain.</i> My party slew him; indeed, I think I slew
him myself. I claim the chain: it belongs to my king; the glory
of Gaul requires it. Never will she endure to see another take it.</p>

<p><i>Hannibal.</i> My friend, the glory of Marcellus did not require
him to wear it. When he suspended the arms of your brave
king in the temple, he thought such a trinket unworthy of himself
and of Jupiter. The shield he battered down, the breast-plate
he pierced with his sword&mdash;these he showed to the people
and to the gods; hardly his wife and little children saw this,
ere his horse wore it.</p>

<p><i>Gaulish Chieftain.</i> Hear me; O Hannibal!</p>

<p><i>Hannibal.</i> What! when Marcellus lies before me? when his
life may perhaps be recalled? when I may lead him in triumph
to Carthage? when Italy, Sicily, Greece, Asia, wait to obey me?
Content thee! I will give thee mine own bridle, worth ten such.</p>

<p><i>Gaulish Chieftain.</i> For myself?</p>

<p><i>Hannibal.</i> For thyself.</p>

<p><i>Gaulish Chieftain.</i> And these rubies and emeralds, and that
scarlet&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Hannibal.</i> Yes, yes.</p>

<p><i>Gaulish Chieftain.</i> O glorious Hannibal! unconquerable
hero! O my happy country! to have such an ally and defender.
I swear eternal gratitude&mdash;yes, gratitude, love, devotion,
beyond eternity.</p>

<p><i>Hannibal.</i> In all treaties we fix the time: I could hardly ask
a longer. Go back to thy station. I would see what the
surgeon is about, and hear what he thinks. The life of Marcellus!
the triumph of Hannibal! what else has the world in it?
Only Rome and Carthage: these follow.</p>

<p><i>Marcellus.</i> I must die then? The gods be praised! The
commander of a Roman army is no captive.</p>

<p><i>Hannibal. [To the Surgeon.]</i> Could not he bear a sea voyage?
Extract the arrow.</p>

<p><i>Surgeon.</i> He expires that moment.</p>

<p><i>Marcellus.</i> It pains me: extract it.</p>

<p><i>Hannibal.</i> Marcellus, I see no expression of pain on your
countenance, and never will I consent to hasten the death of an
enemy in my power. Since your recovery is hopeless, you say
truly you are no captive.</p>

<p>[<i>To the Surgeon.</i>] Is there nothing, man, that can assuage the
mortal pain? for, suppress the signs of it as he may, he must
feel it. Is there nothing to alleviate and allay it?</p>

<p><i>Marcellus.</i> Hannibal, give me thy hand&mdash;thou hast found it
and brought it me, compassion.</p>

<p>[<i>To the Surgeon.</i>] Go, friend; others want thy aid; several
fell around me.</p>

<p><i>Hannibal.</i> Recommend to your country, O Marcellus, while
time permits it, reconciliation and peace with me, informing
the Senate of my superiority in force, and the impossibility of
resistance. The tablet is ready: let me take off this ring&mdash;try
to write, to sign it, at least. Oh, what satisfaction I feel at
seeing you able to rest upon the elbow, and even to smile!</p>

<p><i>Marcellus.</i> Within an hour or less, with how severe a brow
would Minos say to me, &#8216;Marcellus, is this thy writing?&#8217;</p>

<p>Rome loses one man: she hath lost many such, and she still
hath many left.</p>

<p><i>Hannibal.</i> Afraid as you are of falsehood, say you this? I
confess in shame the ferocity of my countrymen. Unfortunately,
too, the nearer posts are occupied by Gauls, infinitely
more cruel. The Numidians are so in revenge: the Gauls both
in revenge and in sport. My presence is required at a distance,
and I apprehend the barbarity of one or other, learning, as they
must do, your refusal to execute my wishes for the common
good, and feeling that by this refusal you deprive them of their
country, after so long an absence.</p>

<p><i>Marcellus.</i> Hannibal, thou art not dying.</p>

<p><i>Hannibal.</i> What then? What mean you?</p>

<p><i>Marcellus.</i> That thou mayest, and very justly, have many
things yet to apprehend: I can have none. The barbarity of
thy soldiers is nothing to me: mine would not dare be cruel.
Hannibal is forced to be absent; and his authority goes away
with his horse. On this turf lies defaced the semblance of a
general; but Marcellus is yet the regulator of his army. Dost
thou abdicate a power conferred on thee by thy nation? Or
wouldst thou acknowledge it to have become, by thy own sole
fault, less plenary than thy adversary&#8217;s?</p>

<p>I have spoken too much: let me rest; this mantle oppresses me.</p>

<p><i>Hannibal.</i> I placed my mantle on your head when the helmet
was first removed, and while you were lying in the sun. Let
me fold it under, and then replace the ring.</p>

<p><i>Marcellus.</i> Take it, Hannibal. It was given me by a poor
woman who flew to me at Syracuse, and who covered it with her
hair, torn off in desperation that she had no other gift to offer.
Little thought I that her gift and her words should be mine.
How suddenly may the most powerful be in the situation of the
most helpless! Let that ring and the mantle under my head
be the exchange of guests at parting. The time may come,
Hannibal, when thou (and the gods alone know whether as
conqueror or conquered) mayest sit under the roof of my
children, and in either case it shall serve thee. In thy adverse
fortune, they will remember on whose pillow their father breathed
his last; in thy prosperity (Heaven grant it may shine upon
thee in some other country!) it will rejoice thee to protect them.
We feel ourselves the most exempt from affliction when we relieve
it, although we are then the most conscious that it may befall us.</p>

<p>There is one thing here which is not at the disposal of either.</p>

<p><i>Hannibal.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>Marcellus.</i> This body.</p>

<p><i>Hannibal.</i> Whither would you be lifted? Men are ready.</p>

<p><i>Marcellus.</i> I meant not so. My strength is failing. I seem
to hear rather what is within than what is without. My sight
and my other senses are in confusion. I would have said&mdash;this
body, when a few bubbles of air shall have left it, is no
more worthy of thy notice than of mine; but thy glory will not
let thee refuse it to the piety of my family.</p>

<p><i>Hannibal.</i> You would ask something else. I perceive an
inquietude not visible till now.</p>

<p><i>Marcellus.</i> Duty and Death make us think of home sometimes.</p>

<p><i>Hannibal.</i> Thitherward the thoughts of the conqueror and
of the conquered fly together.</p>

<p><i>Marcellus.</i> Hast thou any prisoners from my escort?</p>

<p><i>Hannibal.</i> A few dying lie about&mdash;and let them lie&mdash;they are
Tuscans. The remainder I saw at a distance, flying, and but
one brave man among them&mdash;he appeared a Roman&mdash;a youth
who turned back, though wounded. They surrounded and
dragged him away, spurring his horse with their swords. These
Etrurians measure their courage carefully, and tack it well
together before they put it on, but throw it off again with
lordly ease.</p>

<p>Marcellus, why think about them? or does aught else disquiet
your thoughts?</p>

<p><i>Marcellus.</i> I have suppressed it long enough. My son&mdash;my
beloved son!</p>

<p><i>Hannibal.</i> Where is he? Can it be? Was he with you?</p>

<p><i>Marcellus.</i> He would have shared my fate&mdash;and has not.
Gods of my country! beneficent throughout life to me, in death
surpassingly beneficent: I render you, for the last time, thanks.</p>



<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<h2><a name="QUEEN_ELIZABETH_AND_CECIL" id="QUEEN_ELIZABETH_AND_CECIL"></a>QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL</h2>


<p><i>Elizabeth.</i> I advise thee again, churlish Cecil, how that our
Edmund Spenser, whom thou callest most uncourteously a
whining whelp, hath good and solid reason for his complaint.
God&#8217;s blood! shall the lady that tieth my garter and shuffles
the smock over my head, or the lord that steadieth my chair&#8217;s
back while I eat, or the other that looketh to my buck-hounds
lest they be mangy, be holden by me in higher esteem and estate
than he who hath placed me among the bravest of past times,
and will as safely and surely set me down among the loveliest
in the future?</p>

<p><i>Cecil.</i> Your Highness must remember he carouseth fully for
such deserts: fifty pounds a year of unclipped moneys, and a
butt of canary wine; not to mention three thousand acres in
Ireland, worth fairly another fifty and another butt, in seasonable
and quiet years.</p>

<p><i>Elizabeth.</i> The moneys are not enough to sustain a pair of
grooms and a pair of palfreys, and more wine hath been drunken
in my presence at a feast. The moneys are given to such men,
that they may not incline nor be obligated to any vile or lowly
occupation; and the canary, that they may entertain such
promising wits as court their company and converse; and that
in such manner there may be alway in our land a succession
of these heirs unto fame. He hath written, not indeed with his
wonted fancifulness, nor in learned and majestical language,
but in homely and rustic wise, some verses which have moved
me, and haply the more inasmuch as they demonstrate to me
that his genius hath been dampened by his adversities. Read them.</p>

<p><i>Cecil.</i></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How much is lost when neither heart nor eye</span><br />
<span class="i1">Rosewinged Desire or fabling Hope deceives;</span><br />
<span class="i0">When boyhood with quick throb hath ceased to spy</span><br />
<span class="i1">The dubious apple in the yellow leaves;</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When, rising from the turf where youth reposed,</span><br />
<span class="i1">We find but deserts in the far-sought shore;</span><br />
<span class="i0">When the huge book of Faery-land lies closed,</span><br />
<span class="i1">And those strong brazen clasps will yield no more.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Elizabeth.</i> The said Edmund hath also furnished unto the
weaver at Arras, John Blanquieres, on my account, a description
for some of his cunningest wenches to work at, supplied by mine
own self, indeed, as far as the subject-matter goes, but set forth
by him with figures and fancies, and daintily enough bedecked.
I could have wished he had thereunto joined a fair comparison
between Dian&mdash;no matter&mdash;he might perhaps have fared the
better for it; but poets&#8217; wits&mdash;God help them!&mdash;when did they
ever sit close about them? Read the poesy, not over-rich, and
concluding very awkwardly and meanly.</p>

<p><i>Cecil.</i></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where forms the lotus, with its level leaves</span><br />
<span class="i1">And solid blossoms, many floating isles,</span><br />
<span class="i0">What heavenly radiance swift descending cleaves</span><br />
<span class="i1">The darksome wave! Unwonted beauty smiles</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On its pure bosom, on each bright-eyed flower,</span><br />
<span class="i1">On every nymph, and twenty sate around,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lo! &#8217;twas Diana&mdash;from the sultry hour</span><br />
<span class="i1">Hither she fled, nor fear&#8217;d she sight or sound.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Unhappy youth, whom thirst and quiver-reeds</span><br />
<span class="i1">Drew to these haunts, whom awe forbade to fly!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Three faithful dogs before him rais&#8217;d their heads,</span><br />
<span class="i1">And watched and wonder&#8217;d at that fix&egrave;d eye.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Forth sprang his favourite&mdash;with her arrow-hand</span><br />
<span class="i1">Too late the goddess hid what hand may hide,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of every nymph and every reed complain&#8217;d,</span><br />
<span class="i1">And dashed upon the bank the waters wide.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On the prone head and sandal&#8217;d feet they flew&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i1">Lo! slender hoofs and branching horns appear!</span><br />
<span class="i0">The last marr&#8217;d voice not e&#8217;en the favourite knew,</span><br />
<span class="i1">But bay&#8217;d and fasten&#8217;d on the upbraiding deer.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Far be, chaste goddess, far from me and mine</span><br />
<span class="i1">The stream that tempts thee in the summer noon!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Alas, that vengeance dwells with charms divine&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Elizabeth.</i> Pshaw! give me the paper: I forewarned thee how
it ended&mdash;pitifully, pitifully.</p>

<p><i>Cecil.</i> I cannot think otherwise than that the undertaker
of the aforecited poesy hath chosen your Highness; for I have
seen painted&mdash;I know not where, but I think no farther off than
Putney&mdash;the identically same Dian, with full as many nymphs,
as he calls them, and more dogs. So small a matter as a page
of poesy shall never stir my choler nor twitch my purse-string.</p>

<p><i>Elizabeth.</i> I have read in Plinius and Mela of a runlet near
Dodona, which kindled by approximation an unlighted torch,
and extinguished a lighted one. Now, Cecil, I desire no such a
jetty to be celebrated as the decoration of my court: in simpler
words, which your gravity may more easily understand, I would
not from the fountain of honour give lustre to the dull and
ignorant, deadening and leaving in its tomb the lamp of literature
and genius. I ardently wish my reign to be remembered:
if my actions were different from what they are, I should as
ardently wish it to be forgotten. Those are the worst of suicides,
who voluntarily and propensely stab or suffocate their fame,
when God hath commanded them to stand on high for an
example. We call him parricide who destroys the author of
his existence: tell me, what shall we call him who casts forth
to the dogs and birds of prey its most faithful propagator and
most firm support? Mark me, I do not speak of that existence
which the proudest must close in a ditch&mdash;the narrowest, too,
of ditches and the soonest filled and fouled, and whereunto a
pinch of ratsbane or a poppy-head may bend him; but of that
which reposes on our own good deeds, carefully picked up,
skilfully put together, and decorously laid out for us by another&#8217;s
kind understanding: I speak of an existence such as no father
is author of, or provides for. The parent gives us few days and
sorrowful; the poet, many and glorious: the one (supposing him
discreet and kindly) best reproves our faults; the other best
remunerates our virtues.</p>

<p>A page of poesy is a little matter: be it so; but of a truth
I do tell thee, Cecil, it shall master full many a bold heart that
the Spaniard cannot trouble; it shall win to it full many a proud
and flighty one that even chivalry and manly comeliness cannot
touch. I may shake titles and dignities by the dozen from my
breakfast-board; but I may not save those upon whose heads
I shake them from rottenness and oblivion. This year they
and their sovereign dwell together; next year, they and their
beagle. Both have names, but names perishable. The keeper
of my privy seal is an earl: what then? the keeper of my poultry-yard
is a Caesar. In honest truth, a name given to a man is no
better than a skin given to him: what is not natively his own falls
off and comes to nothing.</p>

<p>I desire in future to hear no contempt of penmen, unless a
depraved use of the pen shall have so cramped them as to
incapacitate them for the sword and for the council chamber.
If Alexander was the Great, what was Aristoteles who made
him so, and taught him every art and science he knew, except
three&mdash;those of drinking, of blaspheming, and of murdering his
bosom friends? Come along: I will bring thee back again
nearer home. Thou mightest toss and tumble in thy bed many
nights, and never eke out the substance of a stanza; but Edmund,
if perchance I should call upon him for his counsel, would give
me as wholesome and prudent as any of you. We should
indemnify such men for the injustice we do unto them in not
calling them about us, and for the mortification they must suffer
at seeing their inferiors set before them. Edmund is grave and
gentle: he complains of fortune, not of Elizabeth; of courts,
not of Cecil. I am resolved&mdash;so help me, God!&mdash;he shall have
no further cause for his repining. Go, convey unto him those
twelve silver spoons, with the apostles on them, gloriously
gilded; and deliver into his hand these twelve large golden
pieces, sufficing for the yearly maintenance of another horse
and groom. Beside which, set open before him with due
reverence this Bible, wherein he may read the mercies of God
toward those who waited in patience for His blessing; and this
pair of crimson silk hose, which thou knowest I have worn only
thirteen months, taking heed that the heel-piece be put into
good and sufficient restoration, at my sole charges, by the Italian
woman nigh the pollard elm at Charing Cross.</p>

<h2><a name="EPICTETUS_AND_SENECA" id="EPICTETUS_AND_SENECA"></a>EPICTETUS AND SENECA</h2>


<p><i>Seneca.</i> Epictetus, I desired your master, Epaphroditus, to
send you hither, having been much pleased with his report of
your conduct, and much surprised at the ingenuity of your
writings.</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> Then I am afraid, my friend&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> <i>My friend!</i> are these the expressions&mdash;Well, let it
pass. Philosophers must bear bravely. The people expect it.</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> Are philosophers, then, only philosophers for the
people; and, instead of instructing them, must they play tricks
before them? Give me rather the gravity of dancing dogs.
Their motions are for the rabble; their reverential eyes and
pendant paws are under the pressure of awe at a master; but
they are dogs, and not below their destinies.</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> Epictetus! I will give you three talents to let me
take that sentiment for my own.</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> I would give thee twenty, if I had them, to make
it thine.</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> You mean, by lending it the graces of my language?</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> I mean, by lending it to thy conduct. And now
let me console and comfort thee, under the calamity I brought
on thee by calling thee <i>my friend</i>. If thou art not my friend,
why send for me? Enemy I can have none: being a slave,
Fortune has now done with me.</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> Continue, then, your former observations. What
were you saying?</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> That which thou interruptedst.</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> What was it?</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> I should have remarked that, if thou foundest
ingenuity in my writings, thou must have discovered in them
some deviation from the plain, homely truths of Zeno and
Cleanthes.</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> We all swerve a little from them.</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> In practice too?</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> Yes, even in practice, I am afraid.</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> Often?</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> Too often.</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> Strange! I have been attentive, and yet have
remarked but one difference among you great personages at
Rome.</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> What difference fell under your observation?</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> Crates and Zeno and Cleanthes taught us that our
desires were to be subdued by philosophy alone. In this city,
their acute and inventive scholars take us aside, and show us
that there is not only one way, but two.</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> Two ways?</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> They whisper in our ear, &#8216;These two ways are
philosophy and enjoyment: the wiser man will take the readier,
or, not finding it, the alternative.&#8217; Thou reddenest.</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> Monstrous degeneracy.</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> What magnificent rings! I did not notice them
until thou liftedst up thy hands to heaven, in detestation of
such effeminacy and impudence.</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> The rings are not amiss; my rank rivets them upon
my fingers: I am forced to wear them. Our emperor gave me
one, Epaphroditus another, Tigellinus the third. I cannot lay
them aside a single day, for fear of offending the gods, and those
whom they love the most worthily.</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> Although they make thee stretch out thy fingers,
like the arms and legs of one of us slaves upon a cross.</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> Oh, horrible! Find some other resemblance.</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> The extremities of a fig-leaf.</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> Ignoble!</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> The claws of a toad, trodden on or stoned.</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> You have great need, Epictetus, of an instructor in
eloquence and rhetoric: you want topics, and tropes, and figures.</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> I have no room for them. They make such a
buzz in the house, a man&#8217;s own wife cannot understand what he
says to her.</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> Let us reason a little upon style. I would set you
right, and remove from before you the prejudices of a somewhat
rustic education. We may adorn the simplicity of the wisest.</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> Thou canst not adorn simplicity. What is naked
or defective is susceptible of decoration: what is decorated is
simplicity no longer. Thou mayest give another thing in
exchange for it; but if thou wert master of it, thou wouldst
preserve it inviolate. It is no wonder that we mortals, little
able as we are to see truth, should be less able to express it.</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> You have formed at present no idea of style.</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> I never think about it. First, I consider whether
what I am about to say is true; then, whether I can say it with
brevity, in such a manner as that others shall see it as clearly
as I do in the light of truth; for, if they survey it as an ingenuity,
my desire is ungratified, my duty unfulfilled. I go not with
those who dance round the image of Truth, less out of honour
to her than to display their agility and address.</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> We must attract the attention of readers by novelty,
and force, and grandeur of expression.</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> We must. Nothing is so grand as truth, nothing
so forcible, nothing so novel.</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> Sonorous sentences are wanted to awaken the lethargy
of indolence.</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> Awaken it to what? Here lies the question;
and a weighty one it is. If thou awakenest men where they can
see nothing and do no work, it is better to let them rest: but
will not they, thinkest thou, look up at a rainbow, unless they
are called to it by a clap of thunder?</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> Your early youth, Epictetus, has been, I will not
say neglected, but cultivated with rude instruments and
unskilful hands.</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> I thank God for it. Those rude instruments
have left the turf lying yet toward the sun; and those unskilful
hands have plucked out the docks.</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> We hope and believe that we have attained a vein
of eloquence, brighter and more varied than has been hitherto
laid open to the world.</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> Than any in the Greek?</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> We trust so.</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> Than your Cicero&#8217;s?</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> If the declaration may be made without an offence
to modesty. Surely, you cannot estimate or value the eloquence
of that noble pleader?</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> Imperfectly, not being born in Italy; and the noble
pleader is a much less man with me than the noble philosopher.
I regret that, having farms and villas, he would not keep his
distance from the pumping up of foul words against thieves,
cut-throats, and other rogues; and that he lied, sweated, and
thumped his head and thighs, in behalf of those who were no
better.</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> Senators must have clients, and must protect them.</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> Innocent or guilty?</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> Doubtless.</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> If I regret what is and might not be, I may regret
more what both is and must be. However, it is an amiable
thing, and no small merit in the wealthy, even to trifle and play
at their leisure hours with philosophy. It cannot be expected
that such a personage should espouse her, or should recommend
her as an inseparable mate to his heir.</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> I would.</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> Yes, Seneca, but thou hast no son to make the
match for; and thy recommendation, I suspect, would be given
him before he could consummate the marriage. Every man
wishes his sons to be philosophers while they are young; but
takes especial care, as they grow older, to teach them its insufficiency
and unfitness for their intercourse with mankind.
The paternal voice says: &#8216;You must not be particular; you are
about to have a profession to live by; follow those who have
thriven the best in it.&#8217; Now, among these, whatever be the
profession, canst thou point out to me one single philosopher?</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> Not just now; nor, upon reflection, do I think it
feasible.</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> Thou, indeed, mayest live much to thy ease and
satisfaction with philosophy, having (they say) two thousand
talents.</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> And a trifle to spare&mdash;pressed upon me by that
godlike youth, my pupil Nero.</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> Seneca! where God hath placed a mine, He hath
placed the materials of an earthquake.</p>

<p><i>Seneca.</i> A true philosopher is beyond the reach of Fortune.</p>

<p><i>Epictetus.</i> The false one thinks himself so. Fortune cares
little about philosophers; but she remembers where she hath
set a rich man, and she laughs to see the Destinies at his door.</p>



<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<h2><a name="PETER_THE_GREAT_AND_ALEXIS" id="PETER_THE_GREAT_AND_ALEXIS"></a>PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS</h2>


<p><i>Peter.</i> And so, after flying from thy father&#8217;s house, thou hast
returned again from Vienna. After this affront in the face of
Europe, thou darest to appear before me?</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> My emperor and father! I am brought before your
Majesty, not at my own desire.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> I believe it well.</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> I would not anger you.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> What hope hadst thou, rebel, in thy flight to Vienna?</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> The hope of peace and privacy; the hope of security;
and, above all things, of never more offending you.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> That hope thou hast accomplished.
Thou imaginedst, then, that my brother of Austria would
maintain thee at his court&mdash;speak!</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> No, sir! I imagined that he would have afforded me
a place of refuge.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> Didst thou, then, take money with thee?</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> A few gold pieces.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> How many?</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> About sixty.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> He would have given thee promises for half the money;
but the double of it does not purchase a house, ignorant wretch!</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> I knew as much as that: although my birth did not
appear to destine me to purchase a house anywhere; and
hitherto your liberality, my father, hath supplied my wants of
every kind.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> Not of wisdom, not of duty, not of spirit, not of courage,
not of ambition. I have educated thee among my guards and
horses, among my drums and trumpets, among my flags and
masts. When thou wert a child, and couldst hardly walk,
I have taken thee into the arsenal, though children should not
enter according to regulations: I have there rolled cannon-balls
before thee over iron plates; and I have shown thee bright new
arms, bayonets and sabres; and I have pricked the back of my
hands until the blood came out in many places; and I have
made thee lick it; and I have then done the same to thine.
Afterward, from thy tenth year, I have mixed gunpowder in
thy grog; I have peppered thy peaches; I have poured bilge-water
(with a little good wholesome tar in it) upon thy melons;
I have brought out girls to mock thee and cocker thee, and talk
like mariners, to make thee braver. Nothing would do. Nay,
recollect thee! I have myself led thee forth to the window
when fellows were hanged and shot; and I have shown thee
every day the halves and quarters of bodies; and I have sent
an orderly or chamberlain for the heads; and I have pulled the
cap up from over the eyes; and I have made thee, in spite of
thee, look steadfastly upon them, incorrigible coward!</p>

<p>And now another word with thee about thy scandalous flight
from the palace, in time of quiet, too! To the point! Did my
brother of Austria invite thee? Did he, or did he not?</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> May I answer without doing an injury or disservice
to his Imperial Majesty?</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> Thou mayest. What injury canst thou or any one
do, by the tongue, to such as he is?</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> At the moment, no; he did not. Nor indeed can
I assert that he at any time invited me; but he said he
pitied me.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> About what? hold thy tongue; let that pass. Princes
never pity but when they would make traitors: then their
hearts grow tenderer than tripe. He pitied thee, kind soul,
when he would throw thee at thy father&#8217;s head; but finding thy
father too strong for him, he now commiserates the parent,
laments the son&#8217;s rashness and disobedience, and would not
make God angry for the world. At first, however, there must
have been some overture on his part; otherwise thou are too
shamefaced for intrusion. Come&mdash;thou hast never had wit
enough to lie&mdash;tell me the truth, the whole truth.</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> He said that if ever I wanted an asylum, his court
was open to me.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> Open! so is the tavern; but folks pay for what they
get there. Open, truly! and didst thou find it so?</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> He received me kindly.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> I see he did.</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> Derision, O my father! is not the fate I merit.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> True, true! it was not intended.</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> Kind father! punish me then as you will.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> Villain! wouldst thou kiss my hand, too? Art thou
ignorant that the Austrian threw thee away from him, with the
same indifference as he would the outermost leaf of a sandy
sunburnt lettuce?</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> Alas! I am not ignorant of this.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> He dismissed thee at my order. If I had demanded
from him his daughter, to be the bedfellow of a Kalmuc, he
would have given her, and praised God.</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> O father! is his baseness my crime?</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> No; thine is greater. Thy intention, I know, is to
subvert the institutions it has been the labour of my lifetime to
establish. Thou hast never rejoiced at my victories.</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> I have rejoiced at your happiness and your safety.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> Liar! coward! traitor! when the Polanders and Swedes
fell before me, didst thou from thy soul congratulate me?
Didst thou get drunk at home or abroad, or praise the Lord of
Hosts and Saint Nicholas? Wert thou not silent and civil and
low-spirited?</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> I lamented the irretrievable loss of human life; I
lamented that the bravest and noblest were swept away the
first; that the gentlest and most domestic were the earliest
mourners; that frugality was supplanted by intemperance;
that order was succeeded by confusion; and that your Majesty
was destroying the glorious plans you alone were capable of
devising.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> I destroy them! how? Of what plans art thou
speaking?</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> Of civilizing the Muscovites. The Polanders in part
were civilized: the Swedes, more than any other nation on the
Continent; and so excellently versed were they in military
science, and so courageous, that every man you killed cost you
seven or eight.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> Thou liest; nor six. And civilized, forsooth? Why,
the robes of the metropolitan, him at Upsal, are not worth three
ducats, between Jew and Livornese. I have no notion that
Poland and Sweden shall be the only countries that produce
great princes. What right have they to such as Gustavus and
Sobieski? Europe ought to look to this before discontents
become general, and the people do to us what we have the
privilege of doing to the people. I am wasting my words: there
is no arguing with positive fools like thee. So thou wouldst
have desired me to let the Polanders and Swedes lie still and
quiet! Two such powerful nations!</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> For that reason and others I would have gladly seen
them rest, until our own people had increased in numbers and
prosperity.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> And thus thou disputest my right, before my face,
to the exercise of the supreme power.</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> Sir! God forbid!</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> God forbid, indeed! What care such villains as thou
art what God forbids! He forbids the son to be disobedient
to the father; He forbids&mdash;He forbids&mdash;twenty things. I do not
wish, and will not have, a successor who dreams of dead people.</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> My father! I have dreamed of none such.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> Thou hast, and hast talked about them&mdash;Scythians,
I think, they call &#8217;em. Now, who told thee, Mr. Professor,
that the Scythians were a happier people than we are; that
they were inoffensive; that they were free; that they wandered
with their carts from pasture to pasture, from river to river;
that they traded with good faith; that they fought with good
courage; that they injured none, invaded none, and feared none?
At this rate I have effected nothing. The great founder of
Rome, I heard in Holland, slew his brother for despiting the
weakness of his walls; and shall the founder of this better place
spare a degenerate son, who prefers a vagabond life to a civilized
one, a cart to a city, a Scythian to a Muscovite? Have I not
shaved my people, and breeched them? Have I not formed
them into regular armies, with bands of music and haversacks?
Are bows better than cannon? shepherds than dragoons, mare&#8217;s
milk than brandy, raw steaks than broiled? Thine are tenets
that strike at the root of politeness and sound government.
Every prince in Europe is interested in rooting them out by fire
and sword. There is no other way with false doctrines: breath
against breath does little.</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> Sire, I never have attempted to disseminate my opinions.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> How couldst thou? the seed would fall only on granite.
Those, however, who caught it brought it to me.</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> Never have I undervalued civilization: on the
contrary, I regretted whatever impeded it. In my opinion,
the evils that have been attributed to it sprang from its imperfections
and voids; and no nation has yet acquired it more than
very scantily.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> How so? give me thy reasons&mdash;thy fancies, rather;
for reason thou hast none.</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> When I find the first of men, in rank and genius,
hating one another, and becoming slanderers and liars in order
to lower and vilify an opponent; when I hear the God of mercy
invoked to massacres, and thanked for furthering what He
reprobates and condemns&mdash;I look back in vain on any barbarous
people for worse barbarism. I have expressed my admiration
of our forefathers, who, not being Christians, were yet more
virtuous than those who are; more temperate, more just, more
sincere, more chaste, more peaceable.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> Malignant atheist!</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> Indeed, my father, were I malignant I must be an
atheist; for malignity is contrary to the command, and inconsistent
with the belief, of God.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> Am I Czar of Muscovy, and hear discourses on reason
and religion? from my own son, too! No, by the Holy Trinity!
thou art no son of mine. If thou touchest my knee again, I
crack thy knuckles with this tobacco-stopper: I wish it were a
sledge-hammer for thy sake. Off, sycophant! Off, runaway slave!</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> Father! father! my heart is broken! If I have
offended, forgive me!</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> The State requires thy signal punishment.</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> If the State requires it, be it so; but let my father&#8217;s
anger cease!</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> The world shall judge between us. I will brand thee
with infamy.</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> Until now, O father! I never had a proper sense of
glory. Hear me, O Czar! let not a thing so vile as I am stand
between you and the world! Let none accuse you!</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> Accuse me, rebel! Accuse me, traitor!</p>

<p><i>Alexis.</i> Let none speak ill of you, O my father! The public
voice shakes the palace; the public voice penetrates the grave;
it precedes the chariot of Almighty God, and is heard at the
judgment-seat.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> Let it go to the devil! I will have none of it here in
Petersburg. Our church says nothing about it; our laws
forbid it. As for thee, unnatural brute, I have no more to do
with thee neither!</p>

<p>Ho, there! chancellor! What! come at last! Wert napping,
or counting thy ducats?</p>

<p><i>Chancellor.</i> Your Majesty&#8217;s will and pleasure!</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> Is the Senate assembled in that room?</p>

<p><i>Chancellor.</i> Every member, sire.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> Conduct this youth with thee, and let them judge him;
thou understandest me.</p>

<p><i>Chancellor.</i> Your Majesty&#8217;s commands are the breath of our
nostrils.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> If these rascals are amiss, I will try my new cargo of
Livonian hemp upon &#8217;em.</p>

<p><i>Chancellor.</i> [<i>Returning.</i>] Sire, sire!</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> Speak, fellow! Surely they have not condemned him
to death, without giving themselves time to read the accusation,
that thou comest back so quickly.</p>

<p><i>Chancellor.</i> No, sire! Nor has either been done.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> Then thy head quits thy shoulders.</p>

<p><i>Chancellor.</i> O sire!</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> Curse thy silly <i>sires</i>! what art thou about?</p>

<p><i>Chancellor.</i> Alas! he fell.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> Tie him up to thy chair, then. Cowardly beast!
what made him fall?</p>

<p><i>Chancellor.</i> The hand of Death; the name of father.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> Thou puzzlest me; prithee speak plainlier.</p>

<p><i>Chancellor.</i> We told him that his crime was proven and manifest;
that his life was forfeited.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> So far, well enough.</p>

<p><i>Chancellor.</i> He smiled.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> He did! did he? Impudence shall do him little good.
Who could have expected it from that smock-face! Go on&mdash;what
then?</p>

<p><i>Chancellor.</i> He said calmly, but not without sighing twice
or thrice, &#8216;Lead me to the scaffold: I am weary of life; nobody
loves me.&#8217; I condoled with him, and wept upon his hand,
holding the paper against my bosom. He took the corner of it
between his fingers, and said, &#8216;Read me this paper; read my
death-warrant. Your silence and tears have signified it; yet
the law has its forms. Do not keep me in suspense. My father
says, too truly, I am not courageous; but the death that leads
me to my God shall never terrify me.&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> I have seen these white-livered knaves die resolutely;
I have seen them quietly fierce like white ferrets with their
watery eyes and tiny teeth. You read it?</p>

<p><i>Chancellor.</i> In part, sire! When he heard your Majesty&#8217;s
name accusing him of treason and attempts at rebellion and
parricide, he fell speechless. We raised him up: he was motionless;
he was dead!</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> Inconsiderate and barbarous varlet as thou art, dost
thou recite this ill accident to a father! and to one who has not
dined! Bring me a glass of brandy.</p>

<p><i>Chancellor.</i> And it please your Majesty, might I call a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> Away and bring it: scamper! All equally and alike
shall obey and serve me.</p>

<p>Hark ye! bring the bottle with it: I must cool myself&mdash;and&mdash;hark
ye! a rasher of bacon on thy life! and some pickled
sturgeon, and some krout and caviare, and good strong cheese.</p>

<h2><a name="HENRY_VIII_AND_ANNE_BOLEYN" id="HENRY_VIII_AND_ANNE_BOLEYN"></a>HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN</h2>


<p><i>Henry.</i> Dost thou know me, Nanny, in this yeoman&#8217;s dress?
&#8217;Sblood! does it require so long and vacant a stare to recollect
a husband after a week or two? No tragedy-tricks with me!
a scream, a sob, or thy kerchief a trifle the wetter, were enough.
Why, verily the little fool faints in earnest. These whey faces,
like their kinsfolk the ghosts, give us no warning. Hast had
water enough upon thee? Take that, then: art thyself again?</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> Father of mercies! do I meet again my husband, as
was my last prayer on earth? Do I behold my beloved lord&mdash;in
peace&mdash;and pardoned, my partner in eternal bliss? it was his
voice. I cannot see him: why cannot I? Oh, why do these
pangs interrupt the transports of the blessed?</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Thou openest thy arms: faith! I came for that.
Nanny, thou art a sweet slut. Thou groanest, wench: art in
labour? Faith! among the mistakes of the night, I am ready
to think almost that thou hast been drinking, and that I have not.</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> God preserve your Highness: grant me your forgiveness
for one slight offence. My eyes were heavy; I fell asleep
while I was reading. I did not know of your presence at first;
and, when I did, I could not speak. I strove for utterance: I
wanted no respect for my liege and husband.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> My pretty warm nestling, thou wilt then lie! Thou
wert reading, and aloud too, with thy saintly cup of water by thee,
and&mdash;what! thou art still girlishly fond of those dried cherries!</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> I had no other fruit to offer your Highness the first
time I saw you, and you were then pleased to invent for me some
reason why they should be acceptable. I did not dry these:
may I present them, such as they are? We shall have fresh
next month.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Thou art always driving away from the discourse.
One moment it suits thee to know me, another not.</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> Remember, it is hardly three months since I miscarried.
I am weak, and liable to swoons.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Thou hast, however, thy bridal cheeks, with lustre
upon them when there is none elsewhere, and obstinate lips
resisting all impression; but, now thou talkest about miscarrying,
who is the father of that boy?</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> Yours and mine&mdash;He who hath taken him to his own
home, before (like me) he could struggle or cry for it.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Pagan, or worse, to talk so! He did not come into
the world alive: there was no baptism.</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> I thought only of our loss: my senses are confounded.
I did not give him my milk, and yet I loved him tenderly; for
I often fancied, had he lived, how contented and joyful he would
have made you and England.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> No subterfuges and escapes. I warrant, thou canst
not say whether at my entrance thou wert waking or wandering.</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> Faintness and drowsiness came upon me suddenly.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Well, since thou really and truly sleepedst, what
didst dream of?</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> I begin to doubt whether I did indeed sleep.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Ha! false one&mdash;never two sentences of truth together!
But come, what didst think about, asleep or awake?</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> I thought that God had pardoned me my offences,
and had received me unto Him.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> And nothing more?</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> That my prayers had been heard and my wishes were
accomplishing: the angels alone can enjoy more beatitude than
this.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Vexatious little devil! She says nothing now about
me, merely from perverseness. Hast thou never thought about
me, nor about thy falsehood and adultery?</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> If I had committed any kind of falsehood, in regard
to you or not, I should never have rested until I had thrown
myself at your feet and obtained your pardon; but, if ever I
had been guilty of that other crime, I know not whether I should
have dared to implore it, even of God&#8217;s mercy.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Thou hast heretofore cast some soft glances upon
Smeaton; hast thou not?</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> He taught me to play on the virginals, as you know,
when I was little, and thereby to please your Highness.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> And Brereton and Norris&mdash;what have they taught
thee?</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> They are your servants, and trusty ones.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Has not Weston told thee plainly that he loved thee?</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> Yes; and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> What didst thou?</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> I defied him.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Is that all?</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> I could have done no more if he had told me that he
hated me. Then, indeed, I should have incurred more justly
the reproaches of your Highness: I should have smiled.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> We have proofs abundant: the fellows shall one and
all confront thee. Aye, clap thy hands and kiss thy sleeve,
harlot!</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> Oh that so great a favour is vouchsafed me! My
honour is secure; my husband will be happy again; he will see
my innocence.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Give me now an account of the moneys thou hast
received from me within these nine months. I want them not
back: they are letters of gold in record of thy guilt. Thou hast
had no fewer than fifteen thousand pounds in that period,
without even thy asking; what hast done with it, wanton?</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> I have regularly placed it out to interest.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Where? I demand of thee.</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> Among the needy and ailing. My Lord Archbishop
has the account of it, sealed by him weekly. I also had a copy
myself; those who took away my papers may easily find it;
for there are few others, and they lie open.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Think on my munificence to thee; recollect who
made thee. Dost sigh for what thou hast lost?</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> I do, indeed.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> I never thought thee ambitious; but thy vices creep
out one by one.</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> I do not regret that I have been a queen and am no
longer one; nor that my innocence is called in question by
those who never knew me; but I lament that the good people
who loved me so cordially, hate and curse me; that those who
pointed me out to their daughters for imitation check them
when they speak about me; and that he whom next to God I
have served with most devotion is my accuser.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Wast thou conning over something in that dingy
book for thy defence? Come, tell me, what wast thou reading?</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> This ancient chronicle. I was looking for someone
in my own condition, and must have missed the page. Surely
in so many hundred years there shall have been other young
maidens, first too happy for exaltation, and after too exalted
for happiness&mdash;not, perchance, doomed to die upon a scaffold,
by those they ever honoured and served faithfully; that, indeed,
I did not look for nor think of; but my heart was bounding for
any one I could love and pity. She would be unto me as a
sister dead and gone; but hearing me, seeing me, consoling me,
and being consoled. O my husband! it is so heavenly a thing&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> To whine and whimper, no doubt, is vastly heavenly.</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> I said not so; but those, if there be any such, who never
weep, have nothing in them of heavenly or of earthly. The
plants, the trees, the very rocks and unsunned clouds, show us
at least the semblances of weeping; and there is not an aspect
of the globe we live on, nor of the waters and skies around it,
without a reference and a similitude to our joys or sorrows.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> I do not remember that notion anywhere. Take
care no enemy rake out of it something of materialism. Guard
well thy empty hot brain; it may hatch more evil. As for
those odd words, I myself would fain see no great harm in them,
knowing that grief and frenzy strike out many things which
would else lie still, and neither spurt nor sparkle. I also know
that thou hast never read anything but Bible and history&mdash;the
two worst books in the world for young people, and the most
certain to lead astray both prince and subject. For which
reason I have interdicted and entirely put down the one, and
will (by the blessing of the Virgin and of holy Paul) commit the
other to a rigid censor. If it behoves us kings to enact what
our people shall eat and drink&mdash;of which the most unruly and
rebellious spirit can entertain no doubt&mdash;greatly more doth it
behove us to examine what they read and think. The body
is moved according to the mind and will; we must take care
that the movement be a right one, on pain of God&#8217;s anger in
this life and the next.</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> O my dear husband! it must be a naughty thing,
indeed, that makes Him angry beyond remission. Did you
ever try how pleasant it is to forgive any one? There is nothing
else wherein we can resemble God perfectly and easily.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Resemble God perfectly and easily! Do vile creatures
talk thus of the Creator?</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> No, Henry, when His creatures talk thus of Him,
they are no longer vile creatures! When they know that He
is good, they love Him; and, when they love Him, they are good
themselves. O Henry! my husband and king! the judgments
of our Heavenly Father are righteous; on this, surely, we must
think alike.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> And what, then? Speak out; again I command thee,
speak plainly! thy tongue was not so torpid but this moment.
Art ready? Must I wait?</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> If any doubt remains upon your royal mind of your
equity in this business: should it haply seem possible to you
that passion or prejudice, in yourself or another, may have
warped so strong an understanding&mdash;do but supplicate the
Almighty to strengthen and enlighten it, and He will hear
you.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> What! thou wouldst fain change thy quarters, ay?</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> My spirit is detached and ready, and I shall change
them shortly, whatever your Highness may determine.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Yet thou appearest hale and resolute, and (they tell
me) smirkest and smilest to everybody.</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> The withered leaf catches the sun sometimes, little as
it can profit by it; and I have heard stories of the breeze in
other climates that sets in when daylight is about to close, and
how constant it is, and how refreshing. My heart, indeed, is
now sustained strangely; it became the more sensibly so from
that time forward, when power and grandeur and all things
terrestrial were sunk from sight. Every act of kindness in those
about me gives me satisfaction and pleasure, such as I did not
feel formerly. I was worse before God chastened me; yet I
was never an ingrate. What pains have I taken to find out the
village-girls who placed their posies in my chamber ere I arose
in the morning! How gladly would I have recompensed the
forester who lit up a brake on my birthnight, which else had
warmed him half the winter! But these are times past: I was
not Queen of England.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Nor adulterous, nor heretical.</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> God be praised!</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Learned saint! thou knowest nothing of the lighter,
but perhaps canst inform me about the graver, of them.</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> Which may it be, my liege?</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Which may it be? Pestilence! I marvel that the
walls of this tower do not crack around thee at such impiety.</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> I would be instructed by the wisest of theologians:
such is your Highness.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Are the sins of the body, foul as they are, comparable
to those of the soul?</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> When they are united, they must be worse.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Go on, go on: thou pushest thy own breast against
the sword. God hath deprived thee of thy reason for thy
punishment. I must hear more: proceed, I charge thee.</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> An aptitude to believe one thing rather than another,
from ignorance or weakness, or from the more persuasive
manner of the teacher, or from his purity of life, or from the
strong impression of a particular text at a particular time, and
various things beside, may influence and decide our opinion;
and the hand of the Almighty, let us hope, will fall gently on
human fallibility.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Opinion in matters of faith! rare wisdom! rare religion!
Troth, Anne! thou hast well sobered me. I came rather warmly
and lovingly; but these light ringlets, by the holy rood, shall
not shade this shoulder much longer. Nay, do not start; I
tap it for the last time, my sweetest. If the Church permitted
it, thou shouldst set forth on thy long journey with the Eucharist
between thy teeth, however loath.</p>

<p><i>Anne.</i> Love your Elizabeth, my honoured lord, and God bless
you! She will soon forget to call me. Do not chide her: think
how young she is.</p>

<p>Could I, could I kiss her, but once again! it would comfort
my heart&mdash;or break it.</p>

<h2><a name="JOSEPH_SCALIGER_AND_MONTAIGNE" id="JOSEPH_SCALIGER_AND_MONTAIGNE"></a>JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE</h2>


<p><i>Montaigne.</i> What could have brought you, M. de l&#8217;Escale,
to visit the old man of the mountain, other than a good heart?
Oh, how delighted and charmed I am to hear you speak such
excellent Gascon. You rise early, I see: you must have risen
with the sun, to be here at this hour; it is a stout half-hour&#8217;s
walk from the brook. I have capital white wine, and the best
cheese in Auvergne. You saw the goats and the two cows
before the castle.</p>

<p>Pierre, thou hast done well: set it upon the table, and tell
Master Matthew to split a couple of chickens and broil them,
and to pepper but one. Do you like pepper, M. de l&#8217;Escale?</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> Not much.</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> Hold hard! let the pepper alone: I hate it. Tell
him to broil plenty of ham; only two slices at a time, upon his
salvation.</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> This, I perceive, is the antechamber to your library:
here are your everyday books.</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> Faith! I have no other. These are plenty,
methinks; is not that your opinion?</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> You have great resources within yourself, and therefore
can do with fewer.</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> Why, how many now do you think here may be?</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> I did not believe at first that there could be above
fourscore.</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> Well! are fourscore few?&mdash;are we talking of peas
and beans?</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> I and my father (put together) have written well-nigh
as many.</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> Ah! to write them is quite another thing: but one
reads books without a spur, or even a pat from our Lady Vanity.
How do you like my wine?&mdash;it comes from the little knoll
yonder: you cannot see the vines, those chestnut-trees are
between.</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> The wine is excellent; light, odoriferous, with a
smartness like a sharp child&#8217;s prattle.</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> It never goes to the head, nor pulls the nerves,
which many do as if they were guitar-strings. I drink a couple
of bottles a day, winter and summer, and never am the worse
for it. You gentlemen of the Agennois have better in your
province, and indeed the very best under the sun. I do not
wonder that the Parliament of Bordeaux should be jealous of
their privileges, and call it Bordeaux. Now, if you prefer your
own country wine, only say it: I have several bottles in my cellar,
with corks as long as rapiers, and as polished. I do not know,
M. de l&#8217;Escale, whether you are particular in these matters: not
quite, I should imagine, so great a judge in them as in others?</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> I know three things: wine, poetry, and the world.</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> You know one too many, then. I hardly know
whether I know anything about poetry; for I like Clem Marot
better than Ronsard. Ronsard is so plaguily stiff and stately,
where there is no occasion for it; I verily do think the man
must have slept with his wife in a cuirass.</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> It pleases me greatly that you like Marot. His
versions of the Psalms is lately set to music, and added to the
New Testament of Geneva.</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> It is putting a slice of honeycomb into a barrel
of vinegar, which will never grow the sweeter for it.</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> Surely, you do not think in this fashion of the New
Testament!</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> Who supposes it? Whatever is mild and kindly
is there. But Jack Calvin has thrown bird-lime and vitriol
upon it, and whoever but touches the cover dirties his fingers
or burns them.</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> Calvin is a very great man, I do assure you, M. de
Montaigne.</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> I do not like your great men who beckon me to
them, call me their begotten, their dear child, and their entrails;
and, if I happen to say on any occasion, &#8216;I beg leave, sir, to
dissent a little from you,&#8217; stamp and cry, &#8216;The devil you do!&#8217;
and whistle to the executioner.</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> You exaggerate, my worthy friend!</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> Exaggerate do I, M. de l&#8217;Escale? What was it
he did the other day to the poor devil there with an odd name?&mdash;Melancthon,
I think it is.</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> I do not know: I have received no intelligence of
late from Geneva.</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> It was but last night that our curate rode over
from Lyons (he made two days of it, as you may suppose) and
supped with me. He told me that Jack had got his old friend
hanged and burned. I could not join him in the joke, for I find
none such in the New Testament, on which he would have
founded it; and, if it is one, it is not in my manner or to my taste.</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> I cannot well believe the report, my dear sir. He
was rather urgent, indeed, on the combustion of the heretic
Michael Servetus some years past.</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> A thousand to one, my spiritual guide mistook
the name. He has heard of both, I warrant him, and thinks
in his conscience that either is as good a roast as the other.</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> Theologians are proud and intolerant, and truly
the farthest of all men from theology, if theology means the
rational sense of religion, or indeed has anything to do with
it in any way. Melancthon was the very best of the reformers;
quiet, sedate, charitable, intrepid, firm in friendship, ardent in
faith, acute in argument, and profound in learning.</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> Who cares about his argumentation or his learning,
if he was the rest?</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> I hope you will suspend your judgment on this
affair until you receive some more certain and positive
information.</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> I can believe it of the Sieur Calvin.</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> I cannot. John Calvin is a grave man, orderly and
reasonable.</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> In my opinion he has not the order nor the reason
of my cook. Mat never took a man for a sucking-pig, cleaning
and scraping and buttering and roasting him; nor ever twitched
God by the sleeve and swore He should not have His own way.</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> M. de Montaigne, have you ever studied the doctrine
of predestination?</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> I should not understand it, if I had; and I would
not break through an old fence merely to get into a cavern.
I would not give a fig or a fig-leaf to know the truth of it, as
far as any man can teach it me. Would it make me honester
or happier, or, in other things, wiser?</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> I do not know whether it would materially.</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> I should be an egregious fool then to care about it.
Our disputes on controverted points have filled the country
with missionaries and cut-throats. Both parties have shown
a disposition to turn this comfortable old house of mine into a
fortress. If I had inclined to either, the other would have
done it. Come walk about it with me; after a ride, you can
do nothing better to take off fatigue.</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> A most spacious kitchen!</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> Look up!</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> You have twenty or more flitches of bacon hanging
there.</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> And if I had been a doctor or a captain, I should
have had a cobweb and predestination in the place of them.
Your soldiers of the <i>religion</i> on the one side, and of the <i>good old
faith</i> on the other, would not have left unto me safe and sound
even that good old woman there.</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> Oh, yes! they would, I hope.</p>

<p><i>Old Woman.</i> Why dost giggle, Mat? What should he know
about the business? He speaks mighty bad French, and is as
spiteful as the devil. Praised be God, we have a kind master,
who thinks about us, and feels for us.</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> Upon my word, M. de Montaigne, this gallery is an
interesting one.</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> I can show you nothing but my house and my
dairy. We have no chase in the month of May, you know&mdash;unless
you would like to bait the badger in the stable. This is
rare sport in rainy days.</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> Are you in earnest, M. de Montaigne?</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> No, no, no, I cannot afford to worry him outright:
only a little for pastime&mdash;a morning&#8217;s merriment for the dogs
and wenches.</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> You really are then of so happy a temperament
that, at your time of life, you can be amused by baiting a
badger!</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> Why not? Your father, a wiser and graver and
older man than I am, was amused by baiting a professor or
critic. I have not a dog in the kennel that would treat the
badger worse than brave Julius treated Cardan and Erasmus,
and some dozens more. We are all childish, old as well as
young; and our very last tooth would fain stick, M. de l&#8217;Escale,
in some tender place of a neighbour. Boys laugh at a person
who falls in the dirt; men laugh rather when they make him
fall, and most when the dirt is of their own laying.</p>

<p>Is not the gallery rather cold, after the kitchen? We must
go through it to get into the court where I keep my tame rabbits;
the stable is hard by: come along, come along.</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> Permit me to look a little at those banners. Some
of them are old indeed.</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> Upon my word, I blush to think I never took
notice how they are tattered. I have no fewer than three
women in the house, and in a summer&#8217;s evening, only two
hours long, the worst of these rags might have been darned
across.</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> You would not have done it surely!</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> I am not over-thrifty; the women might have
been better employed. It is as well as it is then; ay?</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> I think so.</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> So be it.</p>

<p><i>Scaliger.</i> They remind me of my own family, we being descended
from the great Cane della Scala, Prince of Verona, and
from the House of Hapsburg, as you must have heard from
my father.</p>

<p><i>Montaigne.</i> What signifies it to the world whether the great
Cane was tied to his grandmother or not? As for the House
of Hapsburg, if you could put together as many such houses
as would make up a city larger than Cairo, they would not be
worth his study, or a sheet of paper on the table of it.</p>

<h2><a name="BOCCACCIO_AND_PETRARCA" id="BOCCACCIO_AND_PETRARCA"></a>BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA</h2>


<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Remaining among us, I doubt not that you would
soon receive the same distinctions in your native country as
others have conferred upon you: indeed, in confidence I may
promise it. For greatly are the Florentines ashamed that the
most elegant of their writers and the most independent of their
citizens lives in exile, by the injustice he had suffered in the
detriment done to his property, through the intemperate
administration of their laws.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Let them recall me soon and honourably: then
perhaps I may assist them to remove their ignominy, which I
carry about with me wherever I go, and which is pointed out
by my exotic laurel.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> There is, and ever will be, in all countries and under
all governments, an ostracism for their greatest men.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> At present we will talk no more about it. To-morrow
I pursue my journey towards Padua, where I am
expected; where some few value and esteem me, honest and
learned and ingenious men; although neither those Transpadane
regions, nor whatever extends beyond them, have yet produced
an equal to Boccaccio.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Then, in the name of friendship, do not go thither!&mdash;form
such rather from your fellow-citizens. I love my equals
heartily; and shall love them the better when I see them raised
up here, from our own mother earth, by you.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Let us continue our walk.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> If you have been delighted (and you say you have
been) at seeing again, after so long an absence, the house and
garden wherein I have placed the relaters of my stories, as
reported in the <i>Decameron</i>, come a little way farther up the
ascent, and we will pass through the vineyard on the west of the
villa. You will see presently another on the right, lying in its
warm little garden close to the roadside, the scene lately of
somewhat that would have looked well, as illustration, in the
midst of your Latin reflections. It shows us that people the
most serious and determined may act at last contrariwise to
the line of conduct they have laid down.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Relate it to me, Messer Giovanni; for you are able
to give reality the merits and charms of fiction, just as easily
as you give fiction the semblance, the stature, and the movement
of reality.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> I must here forgo such powers, if in good truth I
possess them.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> This long green alley, defended by box and cypresses,
is very pleasant. The smell of box, although not sweet, is more
agreeable to me than many that are: I cannot say from what
resuscitation of early and tender feeling. The cypress, too,
seems to strengthen the nerves of the brain. Indeed, I delight
in the odour of most trees and plants.</p>

<p>Will not that dog hurt us?&mdash;he comes closer.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Dog! thou hast the colours of a magpie and the
tongue of one; prithee be quiet: art thou not ashamed?</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Verily he trots off, comforting his angry belly with
his plenteous tail, flattened and bestrewn under it. He looks
back, going on, and puffs out his upper lip without a bark.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> These creatures are more accessible to temperate
and just rebuke than the creatures of our species, usually angry
with less reason, and from no sense, as dogs are, of duty. Look
into that white arcade! Surely it was white the other day; and
now I perceive it is still so: the setting sun tinges it with yellow.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> The house has nothing of either the rustic or the
magnificent about it; nothing quite regular, nothing much
varied. If there is anything at all affecting, as I fear there is,
in the story you are about to tell me, I could wish the edifice
itself bore externally some little of the interesting that I might
hereafter turn my mind toward it, looking out of the catastrophe,
though not away from it. But I do not even find the peculiar
and uncostly decoration of our Tuscan villas: the central turret,
round which the kite perpetually circles in search of pigeons or
smaller prey, borne onward, like the Flemish skater, by effortless
will in motionless progression. The view of Fiesole must be
lovely from that window; but I fancy to myself it loses the
cascade under the single high arch of the Mugnone.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> I think so. In this villa&mdash;come rather farther
off: the inhabitants of it may hear us, if they should happen
to be in the arbour, as most people are at the present hour of
day&mdash;in this villa, Messer Francesco, lives Monna Tita Monalda,
who tenderly loved Amadeo degli Oricellari. She, however, was
reserved and coy; and Father Pietro de&#8217; Pucci, an enemy to
the family of Amadeo, told her nevermore to think of him,
for that, just before he knew her, he had thrown his arm round
the neck of Nunciata Righi, his mother&#8217;s maid, calling her most
immodestly a sweet creature, and of a whiteness that marble
would split with envy at.</p>

<p>Monna Tita trembled and turned pale. &#8216;Father, is the girl
really so very fair?&#8217; said she anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8216;Madonna,&#8217; replied the father, &#8216;after confession she is not
much amiss: white she is, with a certain tint of pink not belonging
to her, but coming over her as through the wing of an angel
pleased at the holy function; and her breath is such, the very
ear smells it: poor, innocent, sinful soul! Hei! The wretch,
Amadeo, would have endangered her salvation.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She must be a wicked girl to let him,&#8217; said Monna Tita.
&#8216;A young man of good parentage and education would not dare
to do such a thing of his own accord. I will see him no more,
however. But it was before he knew me: and it may not be
true. I cannot think any young woman would let a young man
do so, even in the last hour before Lent. Now in what month
was it supposed to be?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Supposed to be!&#8217; cried the father indignantly: &#8216;in June;
I say in June.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh! that now is quite impossible: for on the second of July,
forty-one days from this, and at this very hour of it, he swore
to me eternal love and constancy. I will inquire of him whether
it is true: I will charge him with it.&#8217;</p>

<p>She did. Amadeo confessed his fault, and, thinking it a
venial one, would have taken and kissed her hand as he asked
forgiveness.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Children! children! I will go into the house, and if
their relatives, as I suppose, have approved of the marriage,
I will endeavour to persuade the young lady that a fault like
this, on the repentance of her lover, is not unpardonable. But
first, is Amadeo a young man of loose habits?</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Less than our others: in fact, I never heard of any
deviation, excepting this.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Come, then, with me.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Wait a little.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> I hope the modest Tita, after a trial, will not be too
severe with him.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Severity is far from her nature; but, such is her
purity and innocence, she shed many and bitter tears at his
confession, and declared her unalterable determination of taking
the veil among the nuns of Fiesole. Amadeo fell at her feet,
and wept upon them. She pushed him from her gently, and
told him she would still love him if he would follow her example,
leave the world, and become a friar of San Marco. Amadeo
was speechless; and, if he had not been so, he never would have
made a promise he intended to violate. She retired from him.
After a time he arose, less wounded than benumbed by the sharp
uncovered stones in the garden-walk; and, as a man who fears
to fall from a precipice goes farther from it than is necessary,
so did Amadeo shun the quarter where the gate is, and, oppressed
by his agony and despair, throw his arms across the sundial
and rest his brow upon it, hot as it must have been on a cloudless
day in August. When the evening was about to close, he was
aroused by the cries of rooks overhead; they flew towards
Florence, and beyond; he, too, went back into the city.</p>

<p>Tita fell sick from her inquietude. Every morning ere sunrise
did Amadeo return; but could hear only from the labourers
in the field that Monna Tita was ill, because she had promised
to take the veil and had not taken it, knowing, as she must do,
that the heavenly bridegroom is a bridegroom never to be
trifled with, let the spouse be young and beautiful as she may be.
Amadeo had often conversed with the peasant of the farm,
who much pitied so worthy and loving a gentleman; and, finding
him one evening fixing some thick and high stakes in the ground,
offered to help him. After due thanks, &#8216;It is time,&#8217; said the
peasant, &#8216;to rebuild the hovel and watch the grapes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;This is my house,&#8217; cried he. &#8216;Could I never, in my stupidity,
think about rebuilding it before? Bring me another mat or
two: I will sleep here to-night, to-morrow night, every night,
all autumn, all winter.&#8217;</p>

<p>He slept there, and was consoled at last by hearing that
Monna Tita was out of danger, and recovering from her illness
by spiritual means. His heart grew lighter day after day.
Every evening did he observe the rooks, in the same order,
pass along the same track in the heavens, just over San Marco;
and it now occurred to him, after three weeks, indeed, that
Monna Tita had perhaps some strange idea, in choosing his
monastery, not unconnected with the passage of these birds.
He grew calmer upon it, until he asked himself whether he might
hope. In the midst of this half-meditation, half-dream, his
whole frame was shaken by the voices, however low and gentle,
of two monks, coming from the villa and approaching him. He
would have concealed himself under this bank whereon we are
standing; but they saw him, and called him by name. He now
perceived that the younger of them was Guiberto Oddi, with
whom he had been at school about six or seven years ago, and
who admired him for his courage and frankness when he was
almost a child.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do not let us mortify poor Amadeo,&#8217; said Guiberto to his
companion. &#8216;Return to the road: I will speak a few words to
him, and engage him (I trust) to comply with reason and yield
to necessity.&#8217; The elder monk, who saw he should have to
climb the hill again, assented to the proposal, and went into the
road. After the first embraces and few words, &#8216;Amadeo!
Amadeo!&#8217; said Guiberto, &#8216;it was love that made me a friar;
let anything else make you one.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Kind heart!&#8217; replied Amadeo. &#8216;If death or religion, or hatred
of me, deprives me of Tita Monalda, I will die, where she commanded
me, in the cowl. It is you who prepare her, then, to
throw away her life and mine!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Hold! Amadeo!&#8217; said Guiberto, &#8216;I officiate together with good
Father Fontesecco, who invariably falls asleep amid our holy
function.&#8217;</p>

<p>Now, Messer Francesco, I must inform you that Father
Fontesecco has the heart of a flower. It feels nothing, it wants
nothing; it is pure and simple, and full of its own little light.
Innocent as a child, as an angel, nothing ever troubled him but
how to devise what he should confess. A confession costs him
more trouble to invent than any Giornata in my <i>Decameron</i>
cost me. He was once overheard to say on this occasion,
&#8216;God forgive me in His infinite mercy, for making it appear
that I am a little worse than He has chosen I should be!&#8217; He is
temperate; for he never drinks more than exactly half the wine
and water set before him. In fact, he drinks the wine and
leaves the water, saying: &#8216;We have the same water up at San
Domenico; we send it hither: it would be uncivil to take back
our own gift, and still more to leave a suspicion that we thought
other people&#8217;s wine poor beverage.&#8217; Being afflicted by the gravel,
the physician of his convent advised him, as he never was fond
of wine, to leave it off entirely; on which he said, &#8216;I know few
things; but this I know well&mdash;in water there is often gravel,
in wine never. It hath pleased God to afflict me, and even to
go a little out of His way in order to do it, for the greater warning
to other sinners. I will drink wine, brother Anselmini, and help
His work.&#8217;</p>

<p>I have led you away from the younger monk.</p>

<p>&#8216;While Father Fontesecco is in the first stage of beatitude,
chanting through his nose the <i>Benedicite</i>, I will attempt,&#8217; said
Guiberto, &#8216;to comfort Monna Tita.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Good, blessed Guiberto!&#8217; exclaimed Amadeo in a transport
of gratitude, at which Guiberto smiled with his usual grace
and suavity. &#8216;O Guiberto! Guiberto! my heart is breaking.
Why should she want you to comfort her?&mdash;but&mdash;comfort her
then!&#8217; and he covered his face within his hands.</p>

<p>&#8216;Remember,&#8217; said Guiberto placidly, &#8216;her uncle is bedridden;
her aunt never leaves him; the servants are old and sullen, and
will stir for nobody. Finding her resolved, as they believe, to
become a nun, they are little assiduous in their services.
Humour her, if none else does, Amadeo; let her fancy that you
intend to be a friar; and, for the present, walk not on these
grounds.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you true, or are you traitorous?&#8217; cried Amadeo, grasping
his friend&#8217;s hand most fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8216;Follow your own counsel, if you think mine insincere,&#8217; said
the young friar, not withdrawing his hand, but placing the other
on Amadeo&#8217;s. &#8216;Let me, however, advise you to conceal yourself;
and I will direct Silvestrina to bring you such accounts of her
mistress as may at least make you easy in regard to her health.
Adieu.&#8217;</p>

<p>Amadeo was now rather tranquil; more than he had ever
been, not only since the displeasure of Monna Tita, but since the
first sight of her. Profuse at all times in his gratitude to
Silvestrina, whenever she brought him good news, news better
than usual, he pressed her to his bosom. Silvestrina Pioppi
is about fifteen, slender, fresh, intelligent, lively, good-humoured,
sensitive; and any one but Amadeo might call her very pretty.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Ah, Giovanni! here I find your heart obtaining the
mastery over your vivid and volatile imagination. Well have
you said, the maiden being really pretty, any one but Amadeo
might think her so. On the banks of the Sorga there are
beautiful maids; the woods and the rocks have a thousand times
repeated it. I heard but one echo; I heard but one name: I
would have fled from them for ever at another.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Francesco, do not beat your breast just now:
wait a little. Monna Tita would take the veil. The fatal
certainty was announced to Amadeo by his true Guiberto,
who had earnestly and repeatedly prayed her to consider the
thing a few months longer.</p>

<p>&#8216;I will see her first! By all the saints of heaven I will see
her!&#8217; cried the desperate Amadeo, and ran into the house,
toward the still apartment of his beloved. Fortunately Guiberto
was neither less active nor less strong than he, and overtaking
him at the moment, drew him into the room opposite.
&#8216;If you will be quiet and reasonable, there is yet a possibility
left you,&#8217; said Guiberto in his ear, although perhaps he did not
think it. &#8216;But if you utter a voice or are seen by any one, you
ruin the fame of her you love, and obstruct your own prospects
for ever. It being known that you have not slept in Florence
these several nights, it will be suspected by the malicious that
you have slept in the villa with the connivance of Monna Tita.
Compose yourself; answer nothing; rest where you are: do not
add a worse imprudence to a very bad one. I promise you my
assistance, my speedy return, and best counsel: you shall be
released at daybreak.&#8217; He ordered Silvestrina to supply the
unfortunate youth with the cordials usually administered to
the uncle, or with the rich old wine they were made of; and she
performed the order with such promptitude and attention,
that he was soon in some sort refreshed.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> I pity him from my innermost heart, poor young
man! Alas, we are none of us, by original sin, free from
infirmities or from vices.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> If we could find a man exempt by nature from
vices and infirmities, we should find one not worth knowing:
he would also be void of tenderness and compassion. What
allowances then could his best friends expect from him in their
frailties? What help, consolation, and assistance in their
misfortunes? We are in the midst of a workshop well stored
with sharp instruments: we may do ill with many, unless we
take heed; and good with all, if we will but learn how to employ
them.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> There is somewhat of reason in this. You
strengthen me to proceed with you: I can bear the rest.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Guiberto had taken leave of his friend, and had
advanced a quarter of a mile, which (as you perceive) is nearly
the whole way, on his return to the monastery, when he was
overtaken by some peasants who were hastening homeward
from Florence. The information he collected from them made
him determine to retrace his steps. He entered the room again,
and, from the intelligence he had just acquired, gave Amadeo
the assurance that Monna Tita must delay her entrance into
the convent; for that the abbess had that moment gone down
the hill on her way toward Siena to venerate some holy relics,
carrying with her three candles, each five feet long, to burn
before them; which candles contained many particles of the
myrrh presented at the Nativity of our Saviour by the Wise
Men of the East. Amadeo breathed freely, and was persuaded
by Guiberto to take another cup of old wine, and to eat with
him some cold roast kid, which had been offered him for
<i>merenda</i>. After the agitation of his mind a heavy sleep fell
upon the lover, coming almost before Guiberto departed: so
heavy indeed that Silvestrina was alarmed. It was her apartment;
and she performed the honours of it as well as any lady in
Florence could have done.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> I easily believe it: the poor are more attentive than
the rich, and the young are more compassionate than the old.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> O Francesco! what inconsistent creatures are we!</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> True, indeed! I now foresee the end. He might
have done worse.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> I think so.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> He almost deserved it.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> I think that too.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Wretched mortals! our passions for ever lead us
into this, or worse.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Ay, truly; much worse generally.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> The very twig on which the flowers grew lately
scourges us to the bone in its maturity.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Incredible will it be to you, and, by my faith, to
me it was hardly credible. Certain, however, is it that Guiberto
on his return by sunrise found Amadeo in the arms of sleep.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Not at all, not at all: the truest lover might suffer
and act as he did.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> But, Francesco, there was another pair of arms
about him, worth twenty such, divinity as he is. A loud burst
of laughter from Guiberto did not arouse either of the parties;
but Monna Tita heard it, and rushed into the room, tearing her
hair, and invoking the saints of heaven against the perfidy of
man. She seized Silvestrina by that arm which appeared the
most offending: the girl opened her eyes, turned on her face,
rolled out of bed, and threw herself at the feet of her mistress,
shedding tears, and wiping them away with the only piece of
linen about her. Monna Tita too shed tears. Amadeo still
slept profoundly; a flush, almost of crimson, overspreading his
cheeks. Monna Tita led away, after some pause, poor Silvestrina,
and made her confess the whole. She then wept more
and more, and made the girl confess it again, and explain her
confession. &#8216;I cannot believe such wickedness,&#8217; she cried:
&#8216;he could not be so hardened. O sinful Silvestrina! how will
you ever tell Father Doni one half, one quarter? He never can
absolve you.&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Giovanni, I am glad I did not enter the house; you
were prudent in restraining me. I have no pity for the youth
at all: never did one so deserve to lose a mistress.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Say, rather, to gain a wife.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Absurdity! impossibility!</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> He won her fairly; strangely, and on a strange
table, as he played his game. Listen! that guitar is Monna
Tita&#8217;s. Listen! what a fine voice (do not you think it?) is
Amadeo&#8217;s.</p>

<h2><a name="BOSSUET_AND_THE_DUCHESS_DE_FONTANGES" id="BOSSUET_AND_THE_DUCHESS_DE_FONTANGES"></a>BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES</h2>


<p><i>Bossuet.</i> Mademoiselle, it is the king&#8217;s desire that I compliment
you on the elevation you have attained.</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> O monseigneur, I know very well what you mean.
His Majesty is kind and polite to everybody. The last thing
he said to me was, &#8216;Ang&eacute;lique! do not forget to compliment
Monseigneur the bishop on the dignity I have conferred upon
him, of almoner to the dauphiness. I desired the appointment
for him only that he might be of rank sufficient to confess, now
you are duchess. Let him be your confessor, my little girl.&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> I dare not presume to ask you, mademoiselle, what
was your gracious reply to the condescension of our royal master.</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> Oh, yes! you may. I told him I was almost sure
I should be ashamed of confessing such naughty things to a
person of high rank, who writes like an angel.</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> The observation was inspired, mademoiselle, by your
goodness and modesty.</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> You are so agreeable a man, monseigneur, I
will confess to you, directly, if you like.</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> Have you brought yourself to a proper frame of
mind, young lady?</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> What is that?</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> Do you hate sin?</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> Very much.</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> Are you resolved to leave it off?</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> I have left it off entirely since the king began to
love me. I have never said a spiteful word of anybody since.</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> In your opinion, mademoiselle, are there no other
sins than malice?</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> I never stole anything; I never committed
adultery; I never coveted my neighbour&#8217;s wife; I never killed
any person, though several have told me they should die for me.</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> Vain, idle talk! Did you listen to it?</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> Indeed I did, with both ears; it seemed so funny.</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> You have something to answer for, then.</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> No, indeed, I have not, monseigneur. I have
asked many times after them, and found they were all alive,
which mortified me.</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> So, then! you would really have them die for you?</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> Oh, no, no! but I wanted to see whether they were
in earnest, or told me fibs; for, if they told me fibs, I would
never trust them again.</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> Do you hate the world, mademoiselle?</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> A good deal of it: all Picardy, for example, and
all Sologne; nothing is uglier&mdash;and, oh my life! what frightful
men and women!</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> I would say, in plain language, do you hate the flesh
and the devil?</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> Who does not hate the devil? If you will hold
my hand the while, I will tell him so. I hate you, beast! There
now. As for flesh, I never could bear a fat man. Such people
can neither dance nor hunt, nor do anything that I know of.</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> Mademoiselle Marie-Ang&eacute;lique de Scoraille de
Rousille, Duchess de Fontanges! do you hate titles and
dignities and yourself?</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> Myself! does any one hate me? Why should I
be the first? Hatred is the worst thing in the world: it makes
one so very ugly.</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> To love God, we must hate ourselves. We must
detest our bodies, if we would save our souls.</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> That is hard: how can I do it? I see nothing so
detestable in mine. Do you? To love is easier. I love God
whenever I think of Him, He has been so very good to me; but
I cannot hate myself, if I would. As God hath not hated me,
why should I? Beside, it was He who made the king to love me;
for I heard you say in a sermon that the hearts of kings are in
His rule and governance. As for titles and dignities, I do not
care much about them while his Majesty loves me, and calls
me his Ang&eacute;lique. They make people more civil about us; and
therefore it must be a simpleton who hates or disregards them,
and a hypocrite who pretends it. I am glad to be a duchess.
Manon and Lisette have never tied my garter so as to hurt me
since, nor has the mischievous old La Grange said anything cross
or bold: on the contrary, she told me what a fine colour and
what a plumpness it gave me. Would not you rather be a
duchess than a waiting-maid or a nun, if the king gave you
your choice?</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> Pardon me, mademoiselle, I am confounded at the
levity of your question.</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> I am in earnest, as you see.</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> Flattery will come before you in other and more
dangerous forms: you will be commended for excellences
which do not belong to you; and this you will find as injurious
to your repose as to your virtue. An ingenuous mind feels in
unmerited praise the bitterest reproof. If you reject it, you
are unhappy; if you accept it, you are undone. The compliments
of a king are of themselves sufficient to pervert your
intellect.</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> There you are mistaken twice over. It is not
my person that pleases him so greatly: it is my spirit, my wit,
my talents, my genius, and that very thing which you have
mentioned&mdash;what was it? my intellect. He never complimented
me the least upon my beauty. Others have said that
I am the most beautiful young creature under heaven; a blossom
of Paradise, a nymph, an angel; worth (let me whisper it in
your ear&mdash;do I lean too hard?) a thousand Montespans. But
his Majesty never said more on the occasion than that I was
<i>imparagonable!</i> (what is that?) and that he adored me; holding
my hand and sitting quite still, when he might have romped
with me and kissed me.</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> I would aspire to the glory of converting you.</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> You may do anything with me but convert me:
you must not do that; I am a Catholic born. M. de Turenne
and Mademoiselle de Duras were heretics: you did right there.
The king told the chancellor that he prepared them, that the
business was arranged for you, and that you had nothing to
do but get ready the arguments and responses, which you did
gallantly&mdash;did not you? And yet Mademoiselle de Duras was
very awkward for a long while afterwards in crossing herself,
and was once remarked to beat her breast in the litany with the
points of two fingers at a time, when every one is taught to use
only the second, whether it has a ring upon it or not. I am
sorry she did so; for people might think her insincere in her
conversion, and pretend that she kept a finger for each religion.</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> It would be as uncharitable to doubt the conviction
of Mademoiselle de Duras as that of M. le Mar&eacute;chal.</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> I have heard some fine verses, I can assure you,
monseigneur, in which you are called the conqueror of Turenne.
I should like to have been his conqueror myself, he was so great
a man. I understand that you have lately done a much more
difficult thing.</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> To what do you refer, mademoiselle?</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> That you have overcome quietism. Now, in the
name of wonder, how could you manage that?</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> By the grace of God.</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> Yes, indeed; but never until now did God give
any preacher so much of His grace as to subdue this pest.</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> It has appeared among us but lately.</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> Oh, dear me! I have always been subject to it
dreadfully, from a child.</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> Really! I never heard so.</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> I checked myself as well as I could, although they
constantly told me I looked well in it.</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> In what, mademoiselle?</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> In quietism; that is, when I fell asleep at sermon
time. I am ashamed that such a learned and pious man as
M. de F&eacute;nelon should incline to it,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> as they say he does.</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> Mademoiselle, you quite mistake the matter.</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> Is not then M. de F&eacute;nelon thought a very pious
and learned person?</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> And justly.</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> I have read a great way in a romance he has
begun, about a knight-errant in search of a father. The king
says there are many such about his court; but I never saw them
nor heard of them before. The Marchioness de la Motte, his
relative, brought it to me, written out in a charming hand, as
much as the copy-book would hold; and I got through, I know
not how far. If he had gone on with the nymphs in the grotto,
I never should have been tired of him; but he quite forgot his
own story, and left them at once; in a hurry (I suppose) to set
out upon his mission to Saintonge in the <i>pays de d&#8217;Aunis</i>, where
the king has promised him a famous <i>heretic hunt</i>. He is, I do
assure you, a wonderful creature: he understands so much Latin
and Greek, and knows all the tricks of the sorceresses. Yet
you keep him under.</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> Mademoiselle, if you really have anything to confess,
and if you desire that I should have the honour of absolving you,
it would be better to proceed in it, than to oppress me with
unmerited eulogies on my humble labours.</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> You must first direct me, monseigneur: I have
nothing particular. The king assures me there is no harm whatever
in his love toward me.</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> That depends on your thoughts at the moment.
If you abstract the mind from the body, and turn your heart
toward Heaven&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> O monseigneur, I always did so&mdash;every time but
once&mdash;you quite make me blush. Let us converse about something
else, or I shall grow too serious, just as you made me the
other day at the funeral sermon. And now let me tell you,
my lord, you compose such pretty funeral sermons, I hope I
shall have the pleasure of hearing you preach mine.</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> Rather let us hope, mademoiselle, that the hour
is yet far distant when so melancholy a service will be performed
for you. May he who is unborn be the sad announcer of your
departure hence!<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> May he indicate to those around him many
virtues not perhaps yet full-blown in you, and point triumphantly
to many faults and foibles checked by you in their
early growth, and lying dead on the open road, you shall have
left behind you! To me the painful duty will, I trust, be spared:
I am advanced in age; you are a child.</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> Oh, no! I am seventeen.</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> I should have supposed you younger by two years
at least. But do you collect nothing from your own reflection,
which raises so many in my breast? You think it possible
that I, aged as I am, may preach a sermon at your funeral.
We say that our days are few; and saying it, we say too much.
Marie-Ang&eacute;lique, we have but one: the past are not ours, and
who can promise us the future? This in which we live is ours
only while we live in it; the next moment may strike it off from
us; the next sentence I would utter may be broken and fall
between us.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The beauty that has made a thousand hearts
to beat at one instant, at the succeeding has been without pulse
and colour, without admirer, friend, companion, follower. She
by whose eyes the march of victory shall have been directed,
whose name shall have animated armies at the extremities
of the earth, drops into one of its crevices and mingles with its
dust. Duchess de Fontanges! think on this! Lady! so live
as to think on it undisturbed!</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> O God! I am quite alarmed. Do not talk thus
gravely. It is in vain that you speak to me in so sweet a voice.
I am frightened even at the rattle of the beads about my neck:
take them off, and let us talk on other things. What was it
that dropped on the floor as you were speaking? It seemed to
shake the room, though it sounded like a pin or button.</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> Leave it there!</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> Your ring fell from your hand, my lord bishop!
How quick you are! Could not you have trusted me to pick
it up?</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> Madame is too condescending: had this happened,
I should have been overwhelmed with confusion. My hand is
shrivelled: the ring has ceased to fit it. A mere accident may
draw us into perdition; a mere accident may bestow on us the

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> It pleases me vastly: I admire rubies. I will
ask the king for one exactly like it. This is the time he usually
comes from the chase. I am sorry you cannot be present to
hear how prettily I shall ask him: but that is impossible, you
know; for I shall do it just when I am certain he would give me
anything. He said so himself: he said but yesterday&mdash;</p>

<p>and no actor on the stage was more like a king than his Majesty
was when he spoke it, if he had but kept his wig and robe on.
And yet you know he is rather stiff and wrinkled for so great a
monarch; and his eyes, I am afraid, are beginning to fail him,
he looks so close at things.</p>

<p><i>Bossuet.</i> Mademoiselle, such is the duty of a prince who desires
to conciliate our regard and love.</p>

<p><i>Fontanges.</i> Well, I think so, too, though I did not like it in
him at first. I am sure he will order the ring for me, and I will
confess to you with it upon my finger. But first I must be
cautious and particular to know of him how much it is his royal
will that I should say.</p>

<h2><a name="JOHN_OF_GAUNT_AND_JOANNA_OF_KENT" id="JOHN_OF_GAUNT_AND_JOANNA_OF_KENT"></a>JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT</h2>


<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Joanna, called the Fair Maid of Kent, was cousin of the Black Prince,
whom she married. John of Gaunt was suspected of aiming at the crown
in the beginning of Richard&#8217;s minority, which, increasing the hatred of
the people against him for favouring the sect of Wickliffe, excited them
to demolish his house and to demand his impeachment.</i></p></div>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Joanna.</i> How is this, my cousin, that you are besieged in
your own house by the citizens of London? I thought you were
their idol.</p>

<p><i>Gaunt.</i> If their idol, madam, I am one which they may tread
on as they list when down; but which, by my soul and knighthood!
the ten best battle-axes among them shall find it hard
work to unshrine.</p>

<p>Pardon me: I have no right, perhaps, to take or touch this
hand; yet, my sister, bricks and stones and arrows are not
presents fit for you. Let me conduct you some paces hence.</p>

<p><i>Joanna.</i> I will speak to those below in the street. Quit my
hand: they shall obey me.</p>

<p><i>Gaunt.</i> If you intend to order my death, madam, your guards
who have entered my court, and whose spurs and halberts I
hear upon the staircase, may overpower my domestics; and,
seeing no such escape as becomes my dignity, I submit to you.
Behold my sword and gauntlet at your feet! Some formalities,
I trust, will be used in the proceedings against me. Entitle me,
in my attainder, not John of Gaunt, not Duke of Lancaster,
not King of Castile; nor commemorate my father, the most
glorious of princes, the vanquisher and pardoner of the most
powerful; nor style me, what those who loved or who flattered
me did when I was happier, cousin to the Fair Maid of Kent.
Joanna, those days are over! But no enemy, no law, no
eternity can take away from me, or move further off, my
affinity in blood to the conqueror in the field of Crecy, of Poitiers,
and Najera. Edward was my brother when he was but your
cousin; and the edge of my shield has clinked on his in many a
battle. Yes, we were ever near&mdash;if not in worth, in danger.
She weeps.</p>

<p><i>Joanna.</i> Attainder! God avert it! Duke of Lancaster, what
dark thought&mdash;alas! that the Regency should have known it!
I came hither, sir, for no such purpose as to ensnare or incriminate
or alarm you.</p>

<p>These weeds might surely have protected me from the fresh
tears you have drawn forth.</p>

<p><i>Gaunt.</i> Sister, be comforted! this visor, too, has felt them.</p>

<p><i>Joanna.</i> O my Edward! my own so lately! Thy memory&mdash;thy
beloved image&mdash;which never hath abandoned me, makes
me bold: I dare not say &#8216;generous&#8217;; for in saying it I should
cease to be so&mdash;and who could be called generous by the side
of thee? I will rescue from perdition the enemy of my son.</p>

<p>Cousin, you loved your brother. Love, then, what was
dearer to him than his life: protect what he, valiant as you
have seen him, cannot! The father, who foiled so many, hath
left no enemies; the innocent child, who can injure no one,
finds them!</p>

<p>Why have you unlaced and laid aside your visor? Do not
expose your body to those missiles. Hold your shield before
yourself, and step aside. I need it not. I am resolved&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Gaunt.</i> On what, my cousin? Speak, and, by the saints!
it shall be done. This breast is your shield; this arm is mine.</p>

<p><i>Joanna.</i> Heavens! who could have hurled those masses of
stone from below? they stunned me. Did they descend all
of them together; or did they split into fragments on hitting
the pavement?</p>

<p><i>Gaunt.</i> Truly, I was not looking that way: they came, I
must believe, while you were speaking.</p>

<p><i>Joanna.</i> Aside, aside! further back! disregard <i>me</i>! Look!
that last arrow sticks half its head deep in the wainscot. It
shook so violently I did not see the feather at first.</p>

<p>No, no, Lancaster! I will not permit it. Take your shield
up again; and keep it all before you. Now step aside: I am
resolved to prove whether the people will hear me.</p>

<p><i>Gaunt.</i> Then, madam, by your leave&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Joanna.</i> Hold!</p>

<p><i>Gaunt.</i> Villains! take back to your kitchens those spits and
skewers that you, forsooth, would fain call swords and arrows;
and keep your bricks and stones for your graves!</p>

<p><i>Joanna.</i> Imprudent man! who can save you? I shall be
frightened: I must speak at once.</p>

<p>O good kind people! ye who so greatly loved me, when I
am sure I had done nothing to deserve it, have I (unhappy
me!) no merit with you now, when I would assuage your anger,
protect your fair fame, and send you home contented with
yourselves and me? Who is he, worthy citizens, whom ye would
drag to slaughter?</p>

<p>True, indeed, he did revile someone. Neither I nor you can
say whom&mdash;some feaster and rioter, it seems, who had little
right (he thought) to carry sword or bow, and who, to show it,
hath slunk away. And then another raised his anger: he was
indignant that, under his roof, a woman should be exposed to
stoning. Which of you would not be as choleric in a like affront?
In the house of which among you should I not be protected
as resolutely?</p>

<p>No, no: I never can believe those angry cries. Let none ever
tell me again he is the enemy of my son, of his king, your darling
child, Richard. Are your fears more lively than a poor weak
female&#8217;s? than a mother&#8217;s? yours, whom he hath so often led
to victory, and praised to his father, naming each&mdash;he, John of
Gaunt, the defender of the helpless, the comforter of the desolate,
the rallying signal of the desperately brave!</p>

<p>Retire, Duke of Lancaster! This is no time&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Gaunt.</i> Madam, I obey; but not through terror of that puddle
at the house door, which my handful of dust would dry up.
Deign to command me!</p>

<p><i>Joanna.</i> In the name of my son, then, retire!</p>

<p><i>Gaunt.</i> Angelic goodness! I must fairly win it.</p>

<p><i>Joanna.</i> I think I know his voice that crieth out: &#8216;Who will
answer for him?&#8217; An honest and loyal man&#8217;s, one who would
counsel and save me in any difficulty and danger. With what
pleasure and satisfaction, with what perfect joy and confidence,
do I answer our right-trusty and well-judging friend!</p>

<p>&#8216;Let Lancaster bring his sureties,&#8217; say you, &#8216;and we separate.&#8217;
A moment yet before we separate; if I might delay you so long,
to receive your sanction of those securities: for, in such grave
matters, it would ill become us to be over-hasty. I could bring
fifty, I could bring a hundred, not from among soldiers, not from
among courtiers; but selected from yourselves, were it equitable
and fair to show such partialities, or decorous in the parent and
guardian of a king to offer any other than herself.</p>

<p>Raised by the hand of the Almighty from amidst you, but still
one of you, if the mother of a family is a part of it, here I stand
surety for John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, for his loyalty
and allegiance.</p>

<p><i>Gaunt.</i> [<i>Running back toward Joanna.</i>] Are the rioters, then,
bursting into the chamber through the windows?</p>

<p><i>Joanna.</i> The windows and doors of this solid edifice rattled
and shook at the people&#8217;s acclamation. My word is given for
you: this was theirs in return. Lancaster! what a voice have
the people when they speak out! It shakes me with astonishment,
almost with consternation, while it establishes the throne:
what must it be when it is lifted up in vengeance!</p>

<p><i>Gaunt.</i> Wind; vapour&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Joanna.</i> Which none can wield nor hold. Need I say this
to my cousin of Lancaster?</p>

<p><i>Gaunt.</i> Rather say, madam, that there is always one star
above which can tranquillize and control them.</p>

<p><i>Joanna.</i> Go, cousin! another time more sincerity!</p>

<p><i>Gaunt.</i> You have this day saved my life from the people;
for I now see my danger better, when it is no longer close before
me. My Christ! if ever I forget&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Joanna.</i> Swear not: every man in England hath sworn what
you would swear. But if you abandon my Richard, my brave
and beautiful child, may&mdash;Oh! I could never curse, nor wish
an evil; but, if you desert him in the hour of need, you will
think of those who have not deserted you, and your own great
heart will lie heavy on you, Lancaster!</p>

<p>Am I graver than I ought to be, that you look dejected?
Come, then, gentle cousin, lead me to my horse, and accompany
me home. Richard will embrace us tenderly. Every one is
dear to every other upon rising out fresh from peril; affectionately
then will he look, sweet boy, upon his mother and his
uncle! Never mind how many questions he may ask you, nor
how strange ones. His only displeasure, if he has any, will
be that he stood not against the rioters or among them.</p>

<p><i>Gaunt.</i> Older than he have been as fond of mischief, and as
fickle in the choice of a party.</p>

<p>I shall tell him that, coming to blows, the assailant is often
in the right; that the assailed is always.</p>

<h2><a name="LEOFRIC_AND_GODIVA" id="LEOFRIC_AND_GODIVA"></a>LEOFRIC AND GODIVA</h2>


<p><i>Godiva.</i> There is a dearth in the land, my sweet Leofric!
Remember how many weeks of drought we have had, even in
the deep pastures of Leicestershire; and how many Sundays we
have heard the same prayers for rain, and supplications that
it would please the Lord in His mercy to turn aside His anger
from the poor, pining cattle. You, my dear husband, have
imprisoned more than one malefactor for leaving his dead ox
in the public way; and other hinds have fled before you out of
the traces, in which they, and their sons and their daughters,
and haply their old fathers and mothers, were dragging the
abandoned wain homeward. Although we were accompanied
by many brave spearmen and skilful archers, it was perilous to
pass the creatures which the farmyard dogs, driven from the
hearth by the poverty of their masters, were tearing and devouring;
while others, bitten and lamed, filled the air either with
long and deep howls or sharp and quick barkings, as they
struggled with hunger and feebleness, or were exasperated by
heat and pain. Nor could the thyme from the heath, nor the
bruised branches of the fir-tree, extinguish or abate the foul odour.</p>

<p><i>Leofric.</i> And now, Godiva, my darling, thou art afraid we
should be eaten up before we enter the gates of Coventry; or
perchance that in the gardens there are no roses to greet thee,
no sweet herbs for thy mat and pillow.</p>

<p><i>Godiva.</i> Leofric, I have no such fears. This is the month
of roses: I find them everywhere since my blessed marriage.
They, and all other sweet herbs, I know not why, seem to greet
me wherever I look at them, as though they knew and expected
me. Surely they cannot feel that I am fond of them.</p>

<p><i>Leofric.</i> O light, laughing simpleton! But what wouldst
thou? I came not hither to pray; and yet if praying would
satisfy thee, or remove the drought, I would ride up straightway
to Saint Michael&#8217;s and pray until morning.</p>

<p><i>Godiva.</i> I would do the same, O Leofric! but God hath turned
away His ear from holier lips than mine. Would my own dear
husband hear me, if I implored him for what is easier to accomplish&mdash;what
he can do like God?</p>

<p><i>Leofric.</i> How! what is it?</p>

<p><i>Godiva.</i> I would not, in the first hurry of your wrath, appeal
to you, my loving lord, on behalf of these unhappy men who
have offended you.</p>

<p><i>Leofric.</i> Unhappy! is that all?</p>

<p><i>Godiva.</i> Unhappy they must surely be, to have offended you
so grievously. What a soft air breathes over us! how quiet
and serene and still an evening! how calm are the heavens and
the earth! Shall none enjoy them; not even we, my Leofric?
The sun is ready to set: let it never set, O Leofric, on your anger.
These are not my words: they are better than mine. Should
they lose their virtue from my unworthiness in uttering them?</p>

<p><i>Leofric.</i> Godiva, wouldst thou plead to me for rebels?</p>

<p><i>Godiva.</i> They have, then, drawn the sword against you?
Indeed, I knew it not.</p>

<p><i>Leofric.</i> They have omitted to send me my dues, established
by my ancestors, well knowing of our nuptials, and of the
charges and festivities they require, and that in a season of such
scarcity my own lands are insufficient.</p>

<p><i>Godiva.</i> If they were starving, as they said they were&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Leofric.</i> Must I starve too? Is it not enough to lose my
vassals?</p>

<p><i>Godiva.</i> Enough! O God! too much! too much! May you
never lose them! Give them life, peace, comfort, contentment.
There are those among them who kissed me in my infancy,
and who blessed me at the baptismal font. Leofric, Leofric!
the first old man I meet I shall think is one of those; and I shall
think on the blessing he gave, and (ah me!) on the blessing I
bring back to him. My heart will bleed, will burst; and he will
weep at it! he will weep, poor soul, for the wife of a cruel lord
who denounces vengeance on him, who carries death into his
family!</p>

<p><i>Leofric.</i> We must hold solemn festivals.</p>

<p><i>Godiva.</i> We must, indeed.</p>

<p><i>Leofric.</i> Well, then?</p>

<p><i>Godiva.</i> Is the clamorousness that succeeds the death of
God&#8217;s dumb creatures, are crowded halls, are slaughtered cattle
festivals?&mdash;are maddening songs, and giddy dances, and hireling
praises from parti-coloured coats? Can the voice of a
minstrel tell us better things of ourselves than our own internal
one might tell us; or can his breath make our breath softer in
sleep? O my beloved! let everything be a joyance to us: it
will, if we will. Sad is the day, and worse must follow, when
we hear the blackbird in the garden, and do not throb with joy.
But, Leofric, the high festival is strown by the servant of God
upon the heart of man. It is gladness, it is thanksgiving; it
is the orphan, the starveling, pressed to the bosom, and bidden
as its first commandment to remember its benefactor. We will
hold this festival; the guests are ready: we may keep it up for
weeks, and months, and years together, and always be the
happier and the richer for it. The beverage of this feast, O
Leofric, is sweeter than bee or flower or vine can give us: it
flows from heaven; and in heaven will it abundantly be poured
out again to him who pours it out here abundantly.</p>

<p><i>Leofric.</i> Thou art wild.</p>

<p><i>Godiva.</i> I have, indeed, lost myself. Some Power, some good
kind Power, melts me (body and soul and voice) into tenderness
and love. O my husband, we must obey it. Look upon me!
look upon me! lift your sweet eyes from the ground! I will not
cease to supplicate; I dare not.</p>

<p><i>Leofric.</i> We may think upon it.</p>

<p><i>Godiva.</i> Oh, never say that! What! think upon goodness
when you can be good? Let not the infants cry for sustenance!
The Mother of Our Blessed Lord will hear them; us never,
never afterward.</p>

<p><i>Leofric.</i> Here comes the bishop: we are but one mile from the
walls. Why dismountest thou? no bishop can expect this.
Godiva! my honour and rank among men are humbled by this.
Earl Godwin will hear of it. Up! up! the bishop hath seen it:
he urgeth his horse onward. Dost thou not hear him now upon
the solid turf behind thee?</p>

<p><i>Godiva.</i> Never, no, never will I rise, O Leofric, until you remit
this most impious task&mdash;this tax on hard labour, on hard life.</p>

<p><i>Leofric.</i> Turn round: look how the fat nag canters, as to the
tune of a sinner&#8217;s psalm, slow and hard-breathing. What reason
or right can the people have to complain, while their bishop&#8217;s
steed is so sleek and well caparisoned? Inclination to change,
desire to abolish old usages. Up! up! for shame! They shall
smart for it, idlers! Sir Bishop, I must blush for my young
bride.</p>

<p><i>Godiva.</i> My husband, my husband! will you pardon the city?</p>

<p><i>Leofric.</i> Sir Bishop! I could think you would have seen her
in this plight. Will I pardon? Yea, Godiva, by the holy rood,
will I pardon the city, when thou ridest naked at noontide
through the streets!</p>

<p><i>Godiva.</i> O my dear, cruel Leofric, where is the heart you gave
me? It was not so: can mine have hardened it?</p>

<p><i>Bishop.</i> Earl, thou abashest thy spouse; she turneth pale,
and weepeth. Lady Godiva, peace be with thee.</p>

<p><i>Godiva.</i> Thanks, holy man! peace will be with me when peace
is with your city. Did you hear my lord&#8217;s cruel word?</p>

<p><i>Bishop.</i> I did, lady.</p>

<p><i>Godiva.</i> Will you remember it, and pray against it?</p>

<p><i>Bishop.</i> Wilt <i>thou</i> forget it, daughter?</p>

<p><i>Godiva.</i> I am not offended.</p>

<p><i>Bishop.</i> Angel of peace and purity!</p>

<p><i>Godiva.</i> But treasure it up in your heart: deem it an incense,
good only when it is consumed and spent, ascending with prayer
and sacrifice. And, now, what was it?</p>

<p><i>Bishop.</i> Christ save us! that He will pardon the city when
thou ridest naked through the streets at noon.</p>

<p><i>Godiva.</i> Did he swear an oath?</p>

<p><i>Bishop.</i> He sware by the holy rood.</p>

<p><i>Godiva.</i> My Redeemer, Thou hast heard it! save the city!</p>

<p><i>Leofric.</i> We are now upon the beginning of the pavement:
these are the suburbs. Let us think of feasting: we may pray
afterward; to-morrow we shall rest.</p>

<p><i>Godiva.</i> No judgments, then, to-morrow, Leofric?</p>

<p><i>Leofric.</i> None: we will carouse.</p>

<p><i>Godiva.</i> The saints of heaven have given me strength and
confidence; my prayers are heard; the heart of my beloved is
now softened.</p>

<p><i>Leofric.</i> Ay, ay.</p>

<p><i>Godiva.</i> Say, dearest Leofric, is there indeed no other hope,
no other mediation?</p>

<p><i>Leofric.</i> I have sworn. Beside, thou hast made me redden
and turn my face away from thee, and all the knaves have seen
it: this adds to the city&#8217;s crime.</p>

<p><i>Godiva.</i> I have blushed, too, Leofric, and was not rash nor
obdurate.</p>

<p><i>Leofric.</i> But thou, my sweetest, art given to blushing: there
is no conquering it in thee. I wish thou hadst not alighted so
hastily and roughly: it hath shaken down a sheaf of thy hair.
Take heed thou sit not upon it, lest it anguish thee. Well done!
it mingleth now sweetly with the cloth of gold upon the saddle,
running here and there, as if it had life and faculties and business,
and were working thereupon some newer and cunninger
device. O my beauteous Eve! there is a Paradise about thee!
the world is refreshed as thou movest and breathest on it. I
cannot see or think of evil where thou art. I could throw my
arms even here about thee. No signs for me! no shaking of
sunbeams! no reproof or frown of wonderment.&mdash;I <i>will</i> say it&mdash;now,
then, for worse&mdash;I could close with my kisses thy half-open
lips, ay, and those lovely and loving eyes, before the people.</p>

<p><i>Godiva.</i> To-morrow you shall kiss me, and they shall bless
you for it. I shall be very pale, for to-night I must fast and pray.</p>

<p><i>Leofric.</i> I do not hear thee; the voices of the folk are so loud
under this archway.</p>

<p><i>Godiva.</i> [<i>To herself.</i>] God help them! good kind souls! I hope
they will not crowd about me so to-morrow. O Leofric! could
my name be forgotten, and yours alone remembered! But
perhaps my innocence may save me from reproach; and how
many as innocent are in fear and famine! No eye will open
on me but fresh from tears. What a young mother for so large
a family! Shall my youth harm me? Under God&#8217;s hand it
gives me courage. Ah! when will the morning come? Ah!
when will the noon be over?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The story of Godiva, at one of whose festivals or fairs I was present in

<h2><a name="ESSEX_AND_SPENSER" id="ESSEX_AND_SPENSER"></a>ESSEX AND SPENSER</h2>


<p><i>Essex.</i> Instantly on hearing of thy arrival from Ireland, I
sent a message to thee, good Edmund, that I might learn, from
one so judicious and dispassionate as thou art, the real state
of things in that distracted country; it having pleased the
queen&#8217;s Majesty to think of appointing me her deputy, in order
to bring the rebellious to submission.</p>

<p><i>Spenser.</i> Wisely and well considered; but more worthily
of her judgment than her affection. May your lordship overcome,
as you have ever done, the difficulties and dangers you
foresee.</p>

<p><i>Essex.</i> We grow weak by striking at random; and knowing
that I must strike, and strike heavily, I would fain see exactly
where the stroke shall fall.</p>

<p>Now what tale have you for us?</p>

<p><i>Spenser.</i> Interrogate me, my lord, that I may answer each
question distinctly, my mind being in sad confusion at what I
have seen and undergone.</p>

<p><i>Essex.</i> Give me thy account and opinion of these very affairs
as thou leftest them; for I would rather know one part well
than all imperfectly; and the violences of which I have heard
within the day surpass belief.</p>

<p>Why weepest thou, my gentle Spenser? Have the rebels
sacked thy house?</p>

<p><i>Spenser.</i> They have plundered and utterly destroyed it.</p>

<p><i>Essex.</i> I grieve for thee, and will see thee righted.</p>

<p><i>Spenser.</i> In this they have little harmed me.</p>

<p><i>Essex.</i> How! I have heard it reported that thy grounds are
fertile, and thy mansion large and pleasant.</p>

<p><i>Spenser.</i> If river and lake and meadow-ground and mountain
could render any place the abode of pleasantness, pleasant was
mine, indeed!</p>

<p>On the lovely banks of Mulla I found deep contentment.
Under the dark alders did I muse and meditate. Innocent
hopes were my gravest cares, and my playfullest fancy was
with kindly wishes. Ah! surely of all cruelties the worst is to
extinguish our kindness. Mine is gone: I love the people and
the land no longer. My lord, ask me not about them: I may
speak injuriously.</p>

<p><i>Essex.</i> Think rather, then, of thy happier hours and busier
occupations; these likewise may instruct me.</p>

<p><i>Spenser.</i> The first seeds I sowed in the garden, ere the old
castle was made habitable for my lovely bride, were acorns
from Penshurst. I planted a little oak before my mansion at
the birth of each child. My sons, I said to myself, shall often
play in the shade of them when I am gone; and every year shall
they take the measure of their growth, as fondly as I take theirs.</p>

<p><i>Essex.</i> Well, well; but let not this thought make thee weep so
bitterly.</p>

<p><i>Spenser.</i> Poison may ooze from beautiful plants; deadly grief
from dearest reminiscences. I <i>must</i> grieve, I <i>must</i> weep: it
seems the law of God, and the only one that men are not disposed
to contravene. In the performance of this alone do they
effectually aid one another.</p>

<p><i>Essex.</i> Spenser! I wish I had at hand any arguments or
persuasions of force sufficient to remove thy sorrow; but, really,
I am not in the habit of seeing men grieve at anything except
the loss of favour at court, or of a hawk, or of a buck-hound.
And were I to swear out condolences to a man of thy discernment,
in the same round, roll-call phrases we employ with one
another upon these occasions, I should be guilty, not of insincerity,
but of insolence. True grief hath ever something
sacred in it; and, when it visiteth a wise man and a brave one,
is most holy.</p>

<p>Nay, kiss not my hand: he whom God smiteth hath God
with him. In His presence what am I?</p>

<p><i>Spenser.</i> Never so great, my lord, as at this hour, when you
see aright who is greater. May He guide your counsels, and
preserve your life and glory!</p>

<p><i>Essex.</i> Where are thy friends? Are they with thee?</p>

<p><i>Spenser.</i> Ah, where, indeed! Generous, true-hearted Philip!
where art thou, whose presence was unto me peace and safety;
whose smile was contentment, and whose praise renown?
My lord! I cannot but think of him among still heavier losses:
he was my earliest friend, and would have taught me wisdom.</p>

<p><i>Essex.</i> Pastoral poetry, my dear Spenser, doth not require
tears and lamentations. Dry thine eyes; rebuild thine house:
the queen and council, I venture to promise thee, will make
ample amends for every evil thou hast sustained. What!
does that enforce thee to wail still louder?</p>

<p><i>Spenser.</i> Pardon me, bear with me, most noble heart! I
have lost what no council, no queen, no Essex, can restore.</p>

<p><i>Essex.</i> We will see that. There are other swords, and other
arms to yield them, beside a Leicester&#8217;s and a Raleigh&#8217;s. Others
can crush their enemies, and serve their friends.</p>

<p><i>Spenser.</i> O my sweet child! And of many so powerful,
many so wise and so beneficent, was there none to save thee?
None, none!</p>

<p><i>Essex.</i> I now perceive that thou lamentest what almost every
father is destined to lament. Happiness must be bought,
although the payment may be delayed. Consider: the same
calamity might have befallen thee here in London. Neither
the houses of ambassadors, nor the palaces of kings, nor the
altars of God Himself, are asylums against death. How do I
know but under this very roof there may sleep some latent
calamity, that in an instant shall cover with gloom every inmate
of the house, and every far dependent?</p>

<p><i>Spenser.</i> God avert it!</p>

<p><i>Essex.</i> Every day, every hour of the year, do hundreds mourn
what thou mournest.</p>

<p><i>Spenser.</i> Oh, no, no, no! Calamities there are around us;
calamities there are all over the earth; calamities there are
in all seasons: but none in any season, none in any place, like
mine.</p>

<p><i>Essex.</i> So say all fathers, so say all husbands. Look at any
old mansion-house, and let the sun shine as gloriously as it may
on the golden vanes, or the arms recently quartered over the
gateway or the embayed window, and on the happy pair that
haply is toying at it: nevertheless, thou mayest say that of a
certainty the same fabric hath seen much sorrow within its
chambers, and heard many wailings; and each time this was
the heaviest stroke of all. Funerals have passed along through
the stout-hearted knights upon the wainscot, and amid the
laughing nymphs upon the arras. Old servants have shaken
their heads, as if somebody had deceived them, when they
found that beauty and nobility could perish.</p>

<p>Edmund! the things that are too true pass by us as if they
were not true at all; and when they have singled us out, then
only do they strike us. Thou and I must go too. Perhaps the
next year may blow us away with its fallen leaves.</p>

<p><i>Spenser.</i> For you, my lord, many years (I trust) are waiting:
I never shall see those fallen leaves. No leaf, no bud, will spring
upon the earth before I sink into her breast for ever.</p>

<p><i>Essex.</i> Thou, who art wiser than most men, shouldst bear
with patience, equanimity, and courage what is common to all.</p>

<p><i>Spenser.</i> Enough, enough, enough! Have all men seen their
infant burnt to ashes before their eyes?</p>

<p><i>Essex.</i> Gracious God! Merciful Father! what is this?</p>

<p><i>Spenser.</i> Burnt alive! burnt to ashes! burnt to ashes! The
flames dart their serpent tongues through the nursery window.
I cannot quit thee, my Elizabeth! I cannot lay down our
Edmund! Oh, these flames! They persecute, they enthral me;
they curl round my temples; they hiss upon my brain; they
taunt me with their fierce, foul voices; they carp at me, they
wither me, they consume me, throwing back to me a little of
life to roll and suffer in, with their fangs upon me. Ask me,
my lord, the things you wish to know from me: I may answer
them; I am now composed again. Command me, my gracious
lord! I would yet serve you: soon I shall be unable. You
have stooped to raise me up; you have borne with me; you have
pitied me, even like one not powerful. You have brought
comfort, and will leave it with me, for gratitude is comfort.</p>

<p>Oh! my memory stands all a-tiptoe on one burning point:
when it drops from it, then it perishes. Spare me: ask me
nothing; let me weep before you in peace&mdash;the kindest act of
greatness.</p>

<p><i>Essex.</i> I should rather have dared to mount into the midst
of the conflagration than I now dare entreat thee not to weep.
The tears that overflow thy heart, my Spenser, will staunch
and heal it in their sacred stream; but not without hope in God.</p>

<p><i>Spenser.</i> My hope in God is that I may soon see again what
He has taken from me. Amid the myriads of angels, there is
not one so beautiful; and even he (if there be any) who is
appointed my guardian could never love me so. Ah! these are
idle thoughts, vain wanderings, distempered dreams. If there
ever were guardian angels, he who so wanted one&mdash;my helpless
boy&mdash;would not have left these arms upon my knees.</p>

<p><i>Essex.</i> God help and sustain thee, too gentle Spenser! I
never will desert thee. But what am I? Great they have called
me! Alas, how powerless, then, and infantile is greatness in
the presence of calamity!</p>

<p>Come, give me thy hand: let us walk up and down the gallery.
Bravely done! I will envy no more a Sidney or a Raleigh.</p>

<h2><a name="LORD_BACON_AND_RICHARD_HOOKER" id="LORD_BACON_AND_RICHARD_HOOKER"></a>LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER</h2>


<p><i>Bacon.</i> Hearing much of your worthiness and wisdom, Master
Richard Hooker, I have besought your comfort and consolation
in this my too heavy affliction: for we often do stand in need
of hearing what we know full well, and our own balsams must
be poured into our breasts by another&#8217;s hand. As the air at
our doors is sometimes more expeditious in removing pain and
heaviness from the body than the most far-fetched remedies
would be, so the voice alone of a neighbourly and friendly
visitant may be more effectual in assuaging our sorrows, than
whatever is most forcible in rhetoric and most recondite in
wisdom. On these occasions we cannot put ourselves in a
posture to receive the latter, and still less are we at leisure to
look into the corners of our store-room, and to uncurl the leaves
of our references. As for Memory, who, you may tell me,
would save us the trouble, she is footsore enough in all conscience
with me, without going farther back. Withdrawn as you live
from court and courtly men, and having ears occupied by better
reports than such as are flying about me, yet haply so hard a
case as mine, befalling a man heretofore not averse from the
studies in which you take delight, may have touched you with
some concern.</p>

<p><i>Hooker.</i> I do think, my Lord of Verulam, that, unhappy as
you appear, God in sooth has forgone to chasten you, and that
the day which in His wisdom He appointed for your trial, was
the very day on which the king&#8217;s Majesty gave unto your ward
and custody the great seal of his English realm. And yet
perhaps it may be&mdash;let me utter it without offence&mdash;that your
features and stature were from that day forward no longer
what they were before. Such an effect do power and rank and
office produce even on prudent and religious men.</p>

<p>A hound&#8217;s whelp howleth, if you pluck him up above where
he stood: man, in much greater peril from falling, doth rejoice.
You, my lord, as befitted you, are smitten and contrite, and do
appear in deep wretchedness and tribulation to your servants
and those about you; but I know that there is always a balm
which lies uppermost in these afflictions, and that no heart
rightly softened can be very sore.</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> And yet, Master Richard, it is surely no small matter
to lose the respect of those who looked up to us for countenance;
and the favour of a right learned king; and, O Master Hooker,
such a power of money! But money is mere dross. I should
always hold it so, if it possessed not two qualities: that of making
men treat us reverently, and that of enabling us to help the
needy.</p>

<p><i>Hooker.</i> The respect, I think, of those who respect us for what
a fool can give and a rogue can take away, may easily be
dispensed with; but it is indeed a high prerogative to help the
needy; and when it pleases the Almighty to deprive us of it,
let us believe that He foreknoweth our inclination to negligence
in the charge entrusted to us, and that in His mercy He hath
removed from us a most fearful responsibility.</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> I know a number of poor gentlemen to whom I could
have rendered aid.</p>

<p><i>Hooker.</i> Have you examined and sifted their worthiness?</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> Well and deeply.</p>

<p><i>Hooker.</i> Then must you have known them long before your
adversity, and while the means of succouring them were in
your hands.</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> You have circumvented and entrapped me, Master
Hooker. Faith! I am mortified: you the schoolman, I the
schoolboy!</p>

<p><i>Hooker.</i> Say not so, my lord. Your years, indeed, are fewer
than mine, by seven or thereabout; but your knowledge is
far higher, your experience richer. Our wits are not always in
blossom upon us. When the roses are overcharged and languid,
up springs a spike of rue. Mortified on such an occasion?
God forfend it! But again to the business. I should never
be over-penitent for my neglect of needy gentlemen who have
neglected themselves much worse. They have chosen their
profession with its chances and contingencies. If they had
protected their country by their courage or adorned it by their
studies, they would have merited, and under a king of such
learning and such equity would have received in some sort,
their reward. I look upon them as so many old cabinets of
ivory and tortoise-shell, scratched, flawed, splintered, rotten,
defective both within and without, hard to unlock, insecure to
lock up again, unfit to use.</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> Methinks it beginneth to rain, Master Richard. What
if we comfort our bodies with a small cup of wine, against the
ill-temper of the air. Wherefore, in God&#8217;s name, are you
affrightened?</p>

<p><i>Hooker.</i> Not so, my lord; not so.</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> What then affects you?</p>

<p><i>Hooker.</i> Why, indeed, since your lordship interrogates me&mdash;I
looked, idly and imprudently, into that rich buffet; and I
saw, unless the haze of the weather has come into the parlour,
or my sight is the worse for last night&#8217;s reading, no fewer than
six silver pints. Surely, six tables for company are laid only
at coronations.</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> There are many men so squeamish that forsooth
they would keep a cup to themselves, and never communicate
it to their nearest and best friend; a fashion which seems to
me offensive in an honest house, where no disease of ill repute
ought to be feared. We have lately, Master Richard, adopted
strange fashions; we have run into the wildest luxuries. The
Lord Leicester, I heard it from my father&mdash;God forfend it
should ever be recorded in our history!&mdash;when he entertained
Queen Elizabeth at Kenilworth Castle, laid before her Majesty
a fork of pure silver. I the more easily credit it, as Master
Thomas Coriatt doth vouch for having seen the same monstrous
sign of voluptuousness at Venice. We are surely the especial
favourites of Providence, when such wantonness hath not
melted us quite away. After this portent, it would otherwise
have appeared incredible that we should have broken the
Spanish Armada.</p>

<p>Pledge me: hither comes our wine.</p>

<p>[<i>To the Servant.</i>] Dolt! villain! is not this the beverage I
reserve for myself?</p>

<p>The blockhead must imagine that Malmsey runs in a
stream under the ocean, like the Alpheus. Bear with me,
good Master Hooker, but verily I have little of this wine, and
I keep it as a medicine for my many and growing infirmities.
You are healthy at present: God in His infinite mercy long
maintain you so! Weaker drink is more wholesome for you.
The lighter ones of France are best accommodated by Nature
to our constitutions, and therefore she has placed them so
within our reach that we have only to stretch out our necks,
in a manner, and drink them from the vat. But this Malmsey,
this Malmsey, flies from centre to circumference, and makes
youthful blood boil.</p>

<p><i>Hooker.</i> Of a truth, my knowledge in such matters is but
spare. My Lord of Canterbury once ordered part of a goblet,
containing some strong Spanish wine, to be taken to me from
his table when I dined by sufferance with his chaplains, and,
although a most discreet, prudent man as befitteth his high
station, was not so chary of my health as your lordship. Wine
is little to be trifled with, physic less. The Cretans, the brewers
of this Malmsey, have many aromatic and powerful herbs
among them. On their mountains, and notably on Ida, grows
that dittany which works such marvels, and which perhaps
may give activity to this hot medicinal drink of theirs. I
would not touch it, knowingly: an unregarded leaf, dropped
into it above the ordinary, might add such puissance to the
concoction as almost to break the buckles in my shoes; since
we have good and valid authority that the wounded hart, on
eating thereof, casts the arrow out of his haunch or entrails,
although it stuck a palm deep.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> When I read of such things I doubt them. Religion
and politics belong to God, and to God&#8217;s vicegerent the king;
we must not touch upon them unadvisedly: but if I could
procure a plant of dittany on easy terms, I would persuade my
apothecary and my gamekeeper to make some experiments.</p>

<p><i>Hooker.</i> I dare not distrust what grave writers have declared
in matters beyond my knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> Good Master Hooker, I have read many of your
reasonings, and they are admirably well sustained: added to
which, your genius has given such a strong current to your
language as can come only from a mighty elevation and a most
abundant plenteousness. Yet forgive me, in God&#8217;s name, my
worthy master, if you descried in me some expression of wonder
at your simplicity. We are all weak and vulnerable somewhere:
common men in the higher parts; heroes, as was feigned
of Achilles, in the lower. You would define to a hair&#8217;s-breadth
the qualities, states, and dependencies of principalities, dominations,
and powers; you would be unerring about the apostles
and the churches; and &#8217;tis marvellous how you wander about a
pot-herb!</p>

<p><i>Hooker.</i> I know my poor weak intellects, most noble lord,
and how scantily they have profited by my hard painstaking.
Comprehending few things, and those imperfectly, I say only
what others have said before, wise men and holy; and if, by
passing through my heart into the wide world around me, it
pleaseth God that this little treasure shall have lost nothing of
its weight and pureness, my exultation is then the exultation
of humility. Wisdom consisteth not in knowing many things,
nor even in knowing them thoroughly; but in choosing and in
following what conduces the most certainly to our lasting
happiness and true glory. And this wisdom, my Lord of
Verulam, cometh from above.</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> I have observed among the well-informed and the
ill-informed nearly the same quantity of infirmities and follies:
those who are rather the wiser keep them separate, and those
who are wisest of all keep them better out of sight. Now,
examine the sayings and writings of the prime philosophers,
and you will often find them, Master Richard, to be untruths
made to resemble truths. The business with them is to approximate
as nearly as possible, and not to touch it: the goal of the
charioteer is <i>evitata fervidis rotis</i>, as some poet saith. But we
who care nothing for chants and cadences, and have no time
to catch at applauses, push forward over stones and sands
straightway to our object. I have persuaded men, and shall
persuade them for ages, that I possess a wide range of thought
unexplored by others, and first thrown open by me, with many
fair enclosures of choice and abstruse knowledge. I have
incited and instructed them to examine all subjects of useful
and rational inquiry; few that occurred to me have I myself
left untouched or untried: one, however, hath almost escaped
me, and surely one worth the trouble.</p>

<p><i>Hooker.</i> Pray, my lord, if I am guilty of no indiscretion, what
may it be?</p>

<p><i>Bacon.</i> Francis Bacon.</p>

<h2><a name="OLIVER_CROMWELL_AND_WALTER_NOBLE" id="OLIVER_CROMWELL_AND_WALTER_NOBLE"></a>OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE</h2>


<p><i>Cromwell.</i> What brings thee back from Staffordshire, friend
Walter?</p>

<p><i>Noble.</i> I hope, General Cromwell, to persuade you that the
death of Charles will be considered by all Europe as a most
atrocious action.</p>

<p><i>Cromwell.</i> Thou hast already persuaded me: what then?</p>

<p><i>Noble.</i> Surely, then, you will prevent it, for your authority is
great. Even those who upon their consciences found him
guilty would remit the penalty of blood, some from policy, some
from mercy. I have conversed with Hutchinson, with Ludlow,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
your friend and mine, with Henry Nevile, and Walter Long: you
will oblige these worthy friends, and unite in your favour the
suffrages of the truest and trustiest men living. There are
many others, with whom I am in no habits of intercourse, who
are known to entertain the same sentiments; and these also are
among the country gentlemen, to whom our parliament owes the
better part of its reputation.</p>

<p><i>Cromwell.</i> You country gentlemen bring with you into the
People&#8217;s House a freshness and sweet savour which our citizens
lack mightily. I would fain merit your esteem, heedless of
those pursy fellows from hulks and warehouses, with one ear
lappeted by the pen behind it, and the other an heirloom,
as Charles would have had it, in Laud&#8217;s Star-chamber. Oh,
they are proud and bloody men! My heart melts; but, alas!
my authority is null: I am the servant of the Commonwealth.
I will not, dare not, betray it. If Charles Stuart had threatened
my death only, in the letter we ripped out of the saddle, I would
have reproved him manfully and turned him adrift: but others
are concerned; lives more precious than mine, worn as it is
with fastings, prayers, long services, and preyed upon by a
pouncing disease. The Lord hath led him into the toils laid
for the innocent. Foolish man! he never could eschew evil
counsel.</p>

<p><i>Noble.</i> In comparison with you, he is but as a pinnacle to
a buttress. I acknowledge his weaknesses, and cannot wink
upon his crimes: but that which you visit as the heaviest of
them perhaps was not so, although the most disastrous to both
parties&mdash;the bearing of arms against his people. He fought
for what he considered his hereditary property; we do the same:
should we be hanged for losing a lawsuit?</p>

<p><i>Cromwell.</i> No, unless it is the second. Thou talkest finely
and foolishly, Wat, for a man of thy calm discernment. If a
rogue holds a pistol to my breast, do I ask him who he is?
Do I care whether his doublet be of cat-skin or of dog-skin?
Fie upon such wicked sophisms! Marvellous, how the devil
works upon good men&#8217;s minds!</p>

<p><i>Noble.</i> Charles was always more to be dreaded by his friends
than by his enemies, and now by neither.</p>

<p><i>Cromwell.</i> God forbid that Englishmen should be feared by
Englishmen! but to be daunted by the weakest, to bend before
the worst&mdash;I tell thee, Walter Noble, if Moses and the prophets
commanded me to this villainy, I would draw back and mount
my horse.</p>

<p><i>Noble.</i> I wish that our history, already too dark with blood,
should contain, as far as we are concerned in it, some unpolluted
pages.</p>

<p><i>Cromwell.</i> &#8217;Twere better, much better. Never shall I be
called, I promise thee, an unnecessary shedder of blood.
Remember, my good, prudent friend, of what materials our
sectaries are composed: what hostility against all eminence,
what rancour against all glory. Not only kingly power offends
them, but every other; and they talk of <i>putting to the sword</i>,
as if it were the quietest, gentlest, and most ordinary thing in
the world. The knaves even dictate from their stools and
benches to men in armour, bruised and bleeding for them; and
with school-dames&#8217; scourges in their fists do they give counsel
to those who protect them from the cart and halter. In
the name of the Lord, I must spit outright (or worse) upon
these crackling bouncing firebrands, before I can make them
tractable.</p>

<p><i>Noble.</i> I lament their blindness; but follies wear out the faster
by being hard run upon. This fermenting sourness will presently
turn vapid, and people will cast it out. I am not surprised
that you are discontented and angry at what thwarts
your better nature. But come, Cromwell, overlook them,
despise them, and erect to yourself a glorious name by sparing
a mortal enemy.</p>

<p><i>Cromwell.</i> A glorious name, by God&#8217;s blessing, I will erect;
and all our fellow-labourers shall rejoice at it: but I see better
than they do the blow descending on them, and my arm better
than theirs can ward it off. Noble, thy heart overflows with
kindness for Charles Stuart: if he were at liberty to-morrow
by thy intercession, he would sign thy death-warrant the day
after, for serving the Commonwealth. A generation of vipers!
there is nothing upright nor grateful in them: never was there
a drop of even Scotch blood in their veins. Indeed, we have a
clue to their bedchamber still hanging on the door, and I suspect
that an Italian fiddler or French valet has more than once
crossed the current.</p>

<p><i>Noble.</i> That may be: nor indeed is it credible that any royal
or courtly family has gone on for three generations without a
spur from interloper. Look at France! some stout Parisian
saint performed the last miracle there.</p>

<p><i>Cromwell.</i> Now thou talkest gravely and sensibly: I could hear
thee discourse thus for hours together.</p>

<p><i>Noble.</i> Hear me, Cromwell, with equal patience on matters
more important. We all have our sufferings: why increase
one another&#8217;s wantonly? Be the blood Scotch or English,
French or Italian, a drummer&#8217;s or a buffoon&#8217;s, it carries a soul
upon its stream; and every soul has many places to touch at,
and much business to perform, before it reaches its ultimate
destination. Abolish the power of Charles; extinguish not his
virtues. Whatever is worthy to be loved for anything is worthy
to be preserved. A wise and dispassionate legislator, if any such
should arise among men, will not condemn to death him who has
done, or is likely to do, more service than injury to society.
Blocks and gibbets are the nearest objects to ours, and their
business is never with virtues or with hopes.</p>

<p><i>Cromwell.</i> Walter! Walter! we laugh at speculators.</p>

<p><i>Noble.</i> Many indeed are ready enough to laugh at speculators,
because many profit, or expect to profit, by established and
widening abuses. Speculations toward evil lose their name by
adoption; speculations towards good are for ever speculations,
and he who hath proposed them is a chimerical and silly creature.
Among the matters under this denomination I never find a
cruel project, I never find an oppressive or unjust one: how
happens it?</p>

<p><i>Cromwell.</i> Proportions should exist in all things. Sovereigns
are paid higher than others for their office; they should therefore
be punished more severely for abusing it, even if the
consequences of this abuse were in nothing more grievous or
extensive. We cannot clap them in the stocks conveniently,
nor whip them at the market-place. Where there is a crown
there must be an axe: I would keep it there only.</p>

<p><i>Noble.</i> Lop off the rotten, press out the poisonous, preserve
the rest; let it suffice to have given this memorable example of
national power and justice.</p>

<p><i>Cromwell.</i> Justice is perfect; an attribute of God: we must not
trifle with it.</p>

<p><i>Noble.</i> Should we be less merciful to our fellow-creatures
than to our domestic animals? Before we deliver them to be
killed, we weigh their services against their inconveniences.
On the foundation of policy, when we have no better, let us
erect the trophies of humanity: let us consider that, educated
in the same manner and situated in the same position, we ourselves
might have acted as reprovably. Abolish that for ever
which must else for ever generate abuses; and attribute the
faults of the man to the office, not the faults of the office
to the man.</p>

<p><i>Cromwell.</i> I have no bowels for hypocrisy, and I abominate
and detest kingship.</p>

<p><i>Noble.</i> I abominate and detest hangmanship; but in certain
stages of society both are necessary. Let them go together;
we want neither now.</p>

<p><i>Cromwell.</i> Men, like nails, lose their usefulness when they
lose their direction and begin to bend: such nails are then
thrown into the dust or into the furnace. I must do my duty;
I must accomplish what is commanded me; I must not be turned
aside. I am loath to be cast into the furnace or the dust; but
God&#8217;s will be done! Prithee, Wat, since thou readest, as I see,
the books of philosophers, didst thou ever hear of Digby&#8217;s
remedies by sympathy?</p>

<p><i>Noble.</i> Yes, formerly.</p>

<p><i>Cromwell.</i> Well, now, I protest, I do believe there is something
in them. To cure my headache, I must breathe a vein in the
neck of Charles.</p>

<p><i>Noble.</i> Oliver, Oliver! others are wittiest over wine, thou over
blood: cold-hearted, cruel man.</p>

<p><i>Cromwell.</i> Why, dost thou verily think me so, Walter?
Perhaps thou art right in the main: but He alone who fashioned
me in my mother&#8217;s womb, and who sees things deeper than we
do, knows that.</p>

tossing up of caps; and by these harbingers I knew who were

with him almost before they saluted me, and asked him many
pert questions. What a pleasant spot, Sidney, have you chosen
here for meditation! A solitude is the audience-chamber of

in every fresh posture of the limbs, in every turn the eye takes.</p>

<p>It sometimes requires a stout push, and sometimes a sudden
resistance, in the wisest men, not to become for a moment the
most foolish. What have I done? I have fairly challenged
you, so much my master.</p>

<p><i>Sidney.</i> You have warmed me: I must cool a little and watch
my opportunity. So now, Greville, return you to your invitations,
and I will clear the ground for the company; for Youth,
for Age, and whatever comes between, with kindred and dependencies.
Verily we need no taunts like those in your verses:
here we have few vices, and consequently few repinings. I take
especial care that my young labourers and farmers shall never
be idle, and I supply them with bows and arrows, with bowls and
ninepins, for their Sunday evening,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> lest they drink and quarrel.
In church they are taught to love God; after church they are
practised to love their neighbour: for business on workdays
keeps them apart and scattered, and on market-days they are
prone to a rivalry bordering on malice, as competitors for
custom. Goodness does not more certainly make men happy
than happiness makes them good. We must distinguish between
felicity and prosperity; for prosperity leads often to
ambition, and ambition to disappointment: the course is then
over; the wheel turns round but once; while the reaction of
goodness and happiness is perpetual.</p>

<p><i>Brooke.</i> You reason justly and you act rightly. Piety&mdash;warm,
soft, and passive as the ether round the throne of Grace&mdash;is
made callous and inactive by kneeling too much: her vitality
faints under rigorous and wearisome observances. A forced
match between a man and his religion sours his temper, and leaves
a barren bed.</p>

<p><i>Sidney.</i> Desire of lucre, the worst and most general country
vice, arises here from the necessity of looking to small gains;
it is, however, but the tartar that encrusts economy.</p>

<p><i>Brooke.</i> Oh that anything so monstrous should exist in this
profusion and prodigality of blessings! The herbs, elastic
with health, seem to partake of sensitive and animated life,
and to feel under my hand the benediction I would bestow on
them. What a hum of satisfaction in God&#8217;s creatures! How
is it, Sidney, the smallest do seem the happiest?</p>

<p><i>Sidney.</i> Compensation for their weaknesses and their fears;
compensation for the shortness of their existence. Their spirits
mount upon the sunbeam above the eagle; and they have more
enjoyment in their one summer than the elephant in his century.</p>

<p><i>Brooke.</i> Are not also the little and lowly in our species the
most happy?</p>

<p><i>Sidney.</i> I would not willingly try nor over-curiously examine
it. We, Greville, are happy in these parks and forests: we were
happy in my close winter-walk of box and laurustine. In our
earlier days did we not emboss our bosoms with the daffodils,
and shake them almost unto shedding with our transport?
Ay, my friend, there is a greater difference, both in the stages
of life and in the seasons of the year, than in the conditions of
men: yet the healthy pass through the seasons, from the clement
to the inclement, not only unreluctantly but rejoicingly, knowing
that the worst will soon finish, and the best begin anew; and we
are desirous of pushing forward into every stage of life, excepting
that alone which ought reasonably to allure us most, as opening
to us the <i>Via Sacra</i>, along which we move in triumph to our
eternal country. We may in some measure frame our minds
for the reception of happiness, for more or for less; we should,
however, well consider to what port we are steering in search of
it, and that even in the richest its quantity is but too exhaustible.
There is a sickliness in the firmest of us, which induceth us to
change our side, though reposing ever so softly: yet, wittingly or
unwittingly, we turn again soon into our old position.</p>

<p>God hath granted unto both of us hearts easily contented,
hearts fitted for every station, because fitted for every duty.
What appears the dullest may contribute most to our genius;
what is most gloomy may soften the seeds and relax the fibres
of gaiety. We enjoy the solemnity of the spreading oak above
us: perhaps we owe to it in part the mood of our minds at this
instant; perhaps an inanimate thing supplies me, while I am
speaking, with whatever I possess of animation. Do you imagine
that any contest of shepherds can afford them the same pleasure
as I receive from the description of it; or that even in their
loves, however innocent and faithful, they are so free from
anxiety as I am while I celebrate them? The exertion of
intellectual power, of fancy and imagination, keeps from us
greatly more than their wretchedness, and affords us greatly
more than their enjoyment. We are motes in the midst of
generations: we have our sunbeams to circuit and climb. Look
at the summits of the trees around us, how they move, and the
loftiest the most: nothing is at rest within the compass of our
view, except the grey moss on the park-pales. Let it eat away
the dead oak, but let it not be compared with the living one.</p>

<p>Poets are in general prone to melancholy; yet the most
plaintive ditty hath imparted a fuller joy, and of longer duration,
to its composer, than the conquest of Persia to the Macedonian.
A bottle of wine bringeth as much pleasure as the acquisition
of a kingdom, and not unlike it in kind: the senses in both cases
are confused and perverted.</p>

<p><i>Brooke.</i> Merciful Heaven! and for the fruition of an hour&#8217;s
drunkenness, from which they must awaken with heaviness,
pain, and terror, men consume a whole crop of their kind at
one harvest home. Shame upon those light ones who carol
at the feast of blood! and worse upon those graver ones who nail
upon their escutcheon the name of great! Ambition is but
Avarice on stilts and masked. God sometimes sends a famine,
sometimes a pestilence, and sometimes a hero, for the chastisement
of mankind; none of them surely for our admiration.
Only some cause like unto that which is now scattering the
mental fog of the Netherlands, and is preparing them for the
fruits of freedom, can justify us in drawing the sword abroad.</p>

<p><i>Sidney.</i> And only the accomplishment of our purpose can
permit us again to sheathe it; for the aggrandizement of our
neighbour is nought of detriment to us: on the contrary, if we
are honest and industrious, his wealth is ours. We have nothing
to dread while our laws are equitable and our impositions light:
but children fly from mothers who strip and scourge them.</p>

<p><i>Brooke.</i> We are come to an age when we ought to read and
speak plainly what our discretion tells us is fit: we are not to be
set in a corner for mockery and derision, with our hands hanging
down motionless and our pockets turned inside out.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>But away, away with politics: let not this city-stench infect our
fresh country air!</p>

<h2><a name="SOUTHEY_AND_PORSON" id="SOUTHEY_AND_PORSON"></a>SOUTHEY AND PORSON</h2>


<p><i>Porson.</i> I suspect, Mr. Southey, you are angry with me for
the freedom with which I have spoken of your poetry and
Wordsworth&#8217;s.</p>

<p><i>Southey.</i> What could have induced you to imagine it, Mr.
Professor? You have indeed bent your eyes upon me, since
we have been together, with somewhat of fierceness and defiance:
I presume you fancied me to be a commentator. You wrong
me in your belief that any opinion on my poetical works hath
molested me; but you afford me more than compensation in
supposing me acutely sensible of injustice done to Wordsworth.
If we must converse on these topics, we will converse on him.
What man ever existed who spent a more inoffensive life, or
adorned it with nobler studies?</p>

<p><i>Porson.</i> I believe so; and they who attack him with virulence
are men of as little morality as reflection. I have demonstrated
that one of them, he who wrote the <i>Pursuits of Literature</i>, could
not construe a Greek sentence or scan a verse; and I have fallen
on the very <i>Index</i> from which he drew out his forlorn hope on
the parade. This is incomparably the most impudent fellow
I have met with in the course of my reading, which has lain,
you know, in a province where impudence is no rarity.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>I had visited a friend in <i>King&#8217;s Road</i> when he entered.</p>

<p>&#8216;Have you seen the <i>Review</i>?&#8217; cried he. &#8216;Worse than ever!
I am resolved to insert a paragraph in the papers, declaring that
I had no concern in the last number.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Is it so very bad?&#8217; said I, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Infamous! detestable!&#8217; exclaimed he.</p>

<p>&#8216;Sit down, then: nobody will believe you,&#8217; was my answer.</p>

<p>Since that morning he has discovered that I drink harder
than usual, that my faculties are wearing fast away, that once,
indeed, I had some Greek in my head, but&mdash;he then claps the
forefinger to the side of his nose, turns his eye slowly upward,
and looks compassionately and calmly.</p>

<p><i>Southey.</i> Come, Mr. Porson, grant him his merits: no critic is
better contrived to make any work a monthly one, no writer
more dexterous in giving a finishing touch.</p>

<p><i>Porson.</i> The plagiary has a greater latitude of choice than we;
and if he brings home a parsnip or turnip-top, when he could as
easily have pocketed a nectarine or a pineapple, he must be a
blockhead. I never heard the name of the <i>Pursuer of Literature</i>,
who has little more merit in having stolen than he would have
had if he had never stolen at all; and I have forgotten that other
man&#8217;s, who evinced his fitness to be the censor of our age, by a
translation of the most naked and impure satires of antiquity&mdash;those
of Juvenal, which owe their preservation to the partiality
of the friars. I shall entertain an unfavourable opinion of him
if he has translated them well: pray, has he?</p>

<p><i>Southey.</i> Indeed, I do not know. I read poets for their poetry,
and to extract that nutriment of the intellect and of the heart
which poetry should contain. I never listen to the swans of
the cesspool, and must declare that nothing is heavier to me
than rottenness and corruption.</p>

<p><i>Porson.</i> You are right, sir, perfectly right. A translator of
Juvenal would open a public drain to look for a needle, and may
miss it. My nose is not easily offended; but I must have something
to fill my belly. Come, we will lay aside the scrip of the
transpositor and the pouch of the pursuer, in reserve for the days
of unleavened bread; and again, if you please, to the lakes and
mountains. Now we are both in better humour, I must bring
you to a confession that in your friend Wordsworth there is
occasionally a little trash.</p>

<p><i>Southey.</i> A haunch of venison would be trash to a Brahmin,
a bottle of Burgundy to the xerif of Mecca. We are guided by
precept, by habit, by taste, by constitution. Hitherto our
sentiments on poetry have been delivered down to us from
authority; and if it can be demonstrated, as I think it may be,
that the authority is inadequate, and that the dictates are often
inapplicable and often misinterpreted, you will allow me to
remove the cause out of court. Every man can see what is
very bad in a poem; almost every one can see what is very good:
but you, Mr. Porson, who have turned over all the volumes of
all the commentators, will inform me whether I am right or
wrong in asserting that no critic hath yet appeared who hath
been able to fix or to discern the exact degrees of excellence
above a certain point.</p>

<p><i>Porson.</i> None.</p>

<p><i>Southey.</i> The reason is, because the eyes of no one have been
upon a level with it. Supposing, for the sake of argument, the
contest of Hesiod and Homer to have taken place: the judges
who decided in favour of the worse, and he, indeed, in poetry
has little merit, may have been elegant, wise, and conscientious
men. Their decision was in favour of that to the species of
which they had been the most accustomed. Corinna was
preferred to Pindar no fewer than five times, and the best
judges in Greece gave her the preference; yet whatever were
her powers, and beyond a question they were extraordinary,
we may assure ourselves that she stood many degrees below
Pindar. Nothing is more absurd than the report that the judges
were prepossessed by her beauty. Plutarch tells us that she
was much older than her competitor, who consulted her judgment
in his earlier odes. Now, granting their first competition to
have been when Pindar was twenty years old, and that the
others were in the years succeeding, her beauty must have been
somewhat on the decline; for in Greece there are few women
who retain the graces, none who retain the bloom of youth,
beyond the twenty-third year. Her countenance, I doubt
not, was expressive: but expression, although it gives beauty
to men, makes women pay dearly for its stamp, and pay
soon. Nature seems, in protection to their loveliness, to have
ordered that they who are our superiors in quickness and
sensibility should be little disposed to laborious thought, or to
long excursions in the labyrinths of fancy. We may be convinced
that the verdict of the judges was biased by nothing
else than the habitudes of thinking; we may be convinced, too,
that living in an age when poetry was cultivated highly, and
selected from the most acute and the most dispassionate, they
were subject to no greater errors of opinion than are the learned
messmates of our English colleges.</p>

<p><i>Porson.</i> You are more liberal in your largesses to the fair
Greeks than a friend of mine was, who resided in Athens to
acquire the language. He assured me that beauty there was in
bud at thirteen, in full blossom at fifteen, losing a leaf or two
every day at seventeen, trembling on the thorn at nineteen,
and under the tree at twenty.</p>

<p><i>Southey.</i> Mr. Porson, it does not appear to me that anything
more is necessary, in the first instance, than to interrogate our
hearts in what manner they have been affected. If the ear is
satisfied; if at one moment a tumult is aroused in the breast,
and tranquillized at another, with a perfect consciousness of
equal power exerted in both cases; if we rise up from the perusal
of the work with a strong excitement to thought, to imagination,
to sensibility; above all, if we sat down with some propensities
toward evil, and walk away with much stronger toward good,
in the midst of a world which we never had entered and of which
we never had dreamed before&mdash;shall we perversely put on again
the <i>old man</i> of criticism, and dissemble that we have been
conducted by a most beneficent and most potent genius?
Nothing proves to me so manifestly in what a pestiferous
condition are its lazarettos, as when I observe how little hath
been objected against those who have substituted words for
things, and how much against those who have reinstated things
for words.</p>

<p>Let Wordsworth prove to the world that there may be
animation without blood and broken bones, and tenderness
remote from the stews. Some will doubt it; for even things
the most evident are often but little perceived and strangely
estimated. Swift ridiculed the music of Handel and the
generalship of Marlborough; Pope the perspicacity and the
scholarship of Bentley; Gray the abilities of Shaftesbury and
the eloquence of Rousseau. Shakespeare hardly found those
who would collect his tragedies; Milton was read from godliness;
Virgil was antiquated and rustic; Cicero, Asiatic. What a rabble
has persecuted my friend! An elephant is born to be consumed
by ants in the midst of his unapproachable solitudes: Wordsworth
is the prey of Jeffrey. Why repine? Let us rather amuse
ourselves with allegories, and recollect that God in the creation
left His noblest creature at the mercy of a serpent.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Porson.</i> Wordsworth goes out of his way to be attacked;
he picks up a piece of dirt, throws it on the carpet in the midst
of the company, and cries, <i>This is a better man than any of you!</i>
He does indeed mould the base material into what form he
chooses; but why not rather invite us to contemplate it than
challenge us to condemn it? Here surely is false taste.</p>

<p><i>Southey.</i> The principal and the most general accusation
against him is, that the vehicle of his thoughts is unequal to
them. Now did ever the judges at the Olympic games say:
&#8216;We would have awarded to you the meed of victory, if your
chariot had been equal to your horses: it is true they have won;
but the people are displeased at a car neither new nor richly
gilt, and without a gryphon or sphinx engraved on the axle&#8217;?
You admire simplicity in Euripides; you censure it in Wordsworth:
believe me, sir, it arises in neither from penury of
thought&mdash;which seldom has produced it&mdash;but from the strength
of temperance, and at the suggestion of principle.</p>

<p>Take up a poem of Wordsworth&#8217;s and read it&mdash;I would rather
say, read them all; and, knowing that a mind like yours must
grasp closely what comes within it, I will then appeal to you
whether any poet of our country, since Milton, hath exerted
greater powers with less of strain and less of ostentation. I
would, however, by his permission, lay before you for this purpose
a poem which is yet unpublished and incomplete.</p>

<p><i>Porson.</i> Pity, with such abilities, he does not imitate the
ancients somewhat more.</p>

<p><i>Southey.</i> Whom did they imitate? If his genius is equal to
theirs he has no need of a guide. He also will be an ancient;
and the very counterparts of those who now decry him will
extol him a thousand years hence in malignity to the moderns.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_ABBE_DELILLE_AND_WALTER_LANDOR" id="THE_ABBE_DELILLE_AND_WALTER_LANDOR"></a>THE ABB&Eacute; DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR</h2>


<p>The Abb&eacute; Delille was the happiest of creatures, when he could
weep over the charms of innocence and the country in some
crowded and fashionable circle at Paris. We embraced most
pathetically on our first meeting there, as if the one were
condemned to quit the earth, the other to live upon it.</p>

<p><i>Delille.</i> You are reported to have said that descriptive poetry
has all the merits of a handkerchief that smells of roses?</p>

<p><i>Landor.</i> This, if I said it, is among the things which are neither
false enough nor true enough to be displeasing. But the Abb&eacute;
Delille has merits of his own. To translate Milton well is more
laudable than originality in trifling matters; just as to transport
an obelisk from Egypt, and to erect it in one of the squares,
must be considered a greater labour than to build a new chandler&#8217;s
shop.</p>

<p><i>Delille.</i> Milton is indeed extremely difficult to translate;
for, however noble and majestic, he is sometimes heavy, and
often rough and unequal.</p>

<p><i>Landor.</i> Dear Abb&eacute;, porphyry is heavy, gold is heavier; Ossa
and Olympus are rough and unequal; the steppes of Tartary,
though high, are of uniform elevation: there is not a rock, nor
a birch, nor a cytisus, nor an arbutus upon them great enough
to shelter a new-dropped lamb. Level the Alps one with another,
and where is their sublimity? Raise up the vale of Tempe
to the downs above, and where are those sylvan creeks and
harbours in which the imagination watches while the soul
reposes; those recesses in which the gods partook the weaknesses
of mortals, and mortals the enjoyments of the gods?</p>

<p>You have treated our poet with courtesy and distinction;
in your trimmed and measured dress, he might be taken for a
Frenchman. Do not think me flattering. You have conducted
Eve from Paradise to Paris, and she really looks prettier and
smarter than before she tripped. With what elegance she rises
from a most awful dream! You represent her (I repeat your
expression) as springing up <i>en sursaut</i>, as if you had caught her
asleep and tickled the young creature on that sofa.</p>

<p>Homer and Virgil have been excelled in sublimity by Shakespeare
and Milton, as the Caucasus and Atlas of the old world
by the Andes and Teneriffe of the new; but you would embellish
them all.</p>

<p><i>Delille.</i> I owe to Voltaire my first sentiment of admiration for
Milton and Shakespeare.</p>

<p><i>Landor.</i> He stuck to them as a woodpecker to an old forest-tree,
only for the purpose of picking out what was rotten: he
has made the holes deeper than he found them, and, after all his
cries and chatter, has brought home but scanty sustenance to
his starveling nest.</p>

<p><i>Delille.</i> You must acknowledge that there are fine verses in
his tragedies.</p>

<p><i>Landor.</i> Whenever such is the first observation, be assured,
M. l&#8217;Abb&eacute;, that the poem, if heroic or dramatic, is bad. Should
a work of this kind be excellent, we say, &#8216;How admirably the
characters are sustained! What delicacy of discrimination!
There is nothing to be taken away or altered without an injury
to the part or to the whole.&#8217; We may afterward descend on the
versification. In poetry, there is a greater difference between
the good and the excellent than there is between the bad and
the good. Poetry has no golden mean; mediocrity here is of
another metal, which Voltaire, however, had skill enough to
encrust and polish. In the least wretched of his tragedies,
whatever is tolerable is Shakespeare&#8217;s; but, gracious Heaven!
how deteriorated! When he pretends to extol a poet he chooses
some defective part, and renders it more so whenever he translates
it. I will repeat a few verses from Metastasio in support
of my assertion. Metastasio was both a better critic and a
better poet, although of the second order in each quality; his
tyrants are less philosophical, and his chambermaids less dogmatic.
Voltaire was, however, a man of abilities, and author
of many passable epigrams, beside those which are contained in
his tragedies and heroics; yet it must be confessed that, like your
Parisian lackeys, they are usually the smartest when out of
place.</p>

<p><i>Delille.</i> What you call epigram gives life and spirit to grave
works, and seems principally wanted to relieve a long poem.
I do not see why what pleases us in a star should not please us
in a constellation.</p>

<h2><a name="DIOGENES_AND_PLATO" id="DIOGENES_AND_PLATO"></a>DIOGENES AND PLATO</h2>


<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Stop! stop! come hither! Why lookest thou so
scornfully and askance upon me?</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> Let me go! loose me! I am resolved to pass.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Nay, then, by Jupiter and this tub! thou leavest
three good ells of Milesian cloth behind thee. Whither wouldst
thou amble?</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> I am not obliged in courtesy to tell you.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Upon whose errand? Answer me directly.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> Upon my own.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Oh, then, I will hold thee yet awhile. If it were
upon another&#8217;s, it might be a hardship to a good citizen, though
not to a good philosopher.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> That can be no impediment to my release: you do not
think me one.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> No, by my Father Jove!</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> Your father!</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Why not? Thou shouldst be the last man to doubt
it. Hast not thou declared it irrational to refuse our belief
to those who assert that they are begotten by the gods, though
the assertion (these are thy words) be unfounded on reason or
probability? In me there is a chance of it: whereas in the
generation of such people as thou art fondest of frequenting,
who claim it loudly, there are always too many competitors
to leave it probable.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> Those who speak against the great do not usually
speak from morality, but from envy.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Thou hast a glimpse of the truth in this place,
but as thou hast already shown thy ignorance in attempting
to prove to me what a <i>man</i> is, ill can I expect to learn from thee
what is a <i>great man</i>.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> No doubt your experience and intercourse will afford
me the information.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Attend, and take it. The great man is he who hath
nothing to fear and nothing to hope from another. It is he
who, while he demonstrates the iniquity of the laws, and is
able to correct them, obeys them peaceably. It is he who looks
on the ambitious both as weak and fraudulent. It is he who
hath no disposition or occasion for any kind of deceit, no reason
for being or for appearing different from what he is. It is he
who can call together the most select company when it pleases
him.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> Excuse my interruption. In the beginning of your
definition I fancied that you were designating your own person,
as most people do in describing what is admirable; now I find
that you have some other in contemplation.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> I thank thee for allowing me what perhaps I <i>do</i>
possess, but what I was not then thinking of; as is often the case
with rich possessors: in fact, the latter part of the description
suits me as well as any portion of the former.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> You may call together the best company, by using
your hands in the call, as you did with me; otherwise I am not
sure that you would succeed in it.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> My thoughts are my company; I can bring them
together, select them, detain them, dismiss them. Imbecile
and vicious men cannot do any of these things. Their thoughts
are scattered, vague, uncertain, cumbersome: and the worst
stick to them the longest; many indeed by choice, the greater
part by necessity, and accompanied, some by weak wishes,
others by vain remorse.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> Is there nothing of greatness, O Diogenes! in exhibiting
how cities and communities may be governed best, how morals
may be kept the purest, and power become the most stable?</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> <i>Something</i> of greatness does not constitute the great
man. Let me, however, see him who hath done what thou sayest:
he must be the most universal and the most indefatigable
traveller, he must also be the oldest creature, upon earth.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> How so?</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Because he must know perfectly the climate, the
soil, the situation, the peculiarities, of the races, of their allies,
of their enemies; he must have sounded their harbours, he must
have measured the quantity of their arable land and pasture,
of their woods and mountains; he must have ascertained whether
there are fisheries on their coasts, and even what winds are
prevalent. On these causes, with some others, depend the
bodily strength, the numbers, the wealth, the wants, the
capacities of the people.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> Such are low thoughts.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> The bird of wisdom flies low, and seeks her food
under hedges: the eagle himself would be starved if he always
soared aloft and against the sun. The sweetest fruit grows
near the ground, and the plants that bear it require ventilation
and lopping. Were this not to be done in thy garden, every
walk and alley, every plot and border, would be covered with
runners and roots, with boughs and suckers. We want no
poets or logicians or metaphysicians to govern us: we want
practical men, honest men, continent men, unambitious men,
fearful to solicit a trust, slow to accept, and resolute never to
betray one. Experimentalists may be the best philosophers:
they are always the worst politicians. Teach people their
duties, and they will know their interests. Change as little as
possible, and correct as much.</p>

<p>Philosophers are absurd from many causes, but principally
from laying out unthriftily their distinctions. They set up
four virtues: fortitude, prudence, temperance, and justice.
Now a man may be a very bad one, and yet possess three out of
the four. Every cut-throat must, if he has been a cut-throat
on many occasions, have more fortitude and more prudence
than the greater part of those whom we consider as the best
men. And what cruel wretches, both executioners and judges,
have been strictly just! how little have they cared what gentleness,
what generosity, what genius, their sentence hath removed
from the earth! Temperance and beneficence contain all other
virtues. Take them home, Plato; split them, expound them;
do what thou wilt with them, if thou but use them.</p>

<p>Before I gave thee this lesson, which is a better than thou
ever gavest any one, and easier to remember, thou wert accusing
me of invidiousness and malice against those whom thou callest
the great, meaning to say the powerful. Thy imagination, I
am well aware, had taken its flight toward Sicily, where thou
seekest thy great man, as earnestly and undoubtingly as Ceres
sought her Persephone. Faith! honest Plato, I have no reason
to envy thy worthy friend Dionysius. Look at my nose! A
lad seven or eight years old threw an apple at me yesterday,
while I was gazing at the clouds, and gave me nose enough for
two moderate men. Instead of such a godsend, what should I
have thought of my fortune, if, after living all my lifetime
among golden vases, rougher than my hand with their emeralds
and rubies, their engravings and embossments; among Parian
caryatides and porphyry sphinxes; among philosophers with rings
upon their fingers and linen next their skin; and among singing-boys
and dancing-girls, to whom alone thou speakest intelligibly&mdash;I
ask thee again, what should I in reason have thought of my
fortune, if, after these facilities and superfluities, I had at last
been pelted out of my house, not by one young rogue, but by
thousands of all ages, and not with an apple (I wish I could
say a rotten one), but with pebbles and broken pots; and, to
crown my deserts, had been compelled to become the teacher
of so promising a generation? Great men, forsooth! thou
knowest at last who they are.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> There are great men of various kinds.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> No, by my beard, are there not!</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> What! are there not great captains, great geometricians,
great dialectitians?</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Who denied it? A great man was the postulate.
Try thy hand now at the powerful one.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> On seeing the exercise of power, a child cannot doubt
who is powerful, more or less; for power is relative. All men
are weak, not only if compared to the Demiurgos, but if compared
to the sea or the earth, or certain things upon each of
them, such as elephants and whales. So placid and tranquil
is the scene around us, we can hardly bring to mind the images
of strength and force, the precipices, the abysses&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Prithee hold thy loose tongue, twinkling and glittering
like a serpent&#8217;s in the midst of luxuriance and rankness!
Did never this reflection of thine warn thee that, in human life,
the precipices and abysses would be much farther from our
admiration if we were less inconsiderate, selfish, and vile? I
will not however stop thee long, for thou wert going on quite
consistently. As thy great men are fighters and wranglers,
so thy mighty things upon the earth and sea are troublesome
and intractable encumbrances. Thou perceivedst not what
was greater in the former case, neither art thou aware what is
greater in this. Didst thou feel the gentle air that passed us?</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> I did not, just then.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> That air, so gentle, so imperceptible to thee, is
more powerful not only than all the creatures that breathe and
live by it; not only than all the oaks of the forest, which it rears
in an age and shatters in a moment; not only than all the
monsters of the sea, but than the sea itself, which it tosses up
into foam, and breaks against every rock in its vast circumference;
for it carries in its bosom, with perfect calm and
composure, the incontrollable ocean and the peopled earth,
like an atom of a feather.</p>

<p>To the world&#8217;s turmoils and pageantries is attracted, not only
the admiration of the populace, but the zeal of the orator, the
enthusiasm of the poet, the investigation of the historian, and
the contemplation of the philosopher: yet how silent and invisible
are they in the depths of air! Do I say in those depths and
deserts? No; I say in the distance of a swallow&#8217;s flight&mdash;at
the distance she rises above us, ere a sentence brief as this
could be uttered.</p>

<p>What are its mines and mountains? Fragments welded up
and dislocated by the expansion of water from below; the most
part reduced to mud, the rest to splinters. Afterwards sprang
up fire in many places, and again tore and mangled the mutilated
carcass, and still growls over it.</p>

<p>What are its cities and ramparts, and moles and monuments?
Segments of a fragment, which one man puts together and
another throws down. Here we stumble upon thy great ones
at their work. Show me now, if thou canst, in history, three
great warriors, or three great statesmen, who have acted
otherwise than spiteful children.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> I will begin to look for them in history when I have
discovered the same number in the philosophers or the poets.
A prudent man searches in his own garden after the plant he
wants, before he casts his eyes over the stalls in Kenkrea or
Keramicos.</p>

<p>Returning to your observation on the potency of the air, I
am not ignorant or unmindful of it. May I venture to express
my opinion to you, Diogenes, that the earlier discoverers and
distributors of wisdom (which wisdom lies among us in ruins
and remnants, partly distorted and partly concealed by theological
allegory) meant by Jupiter the air in its agitated state;
by Juno the air in its quiescent. These are the great agents,
and therefore called the king and queen of the gods. Jupiter
is denominated by Homer the <i>compeller of clouds</i>: Juno receives
them, and remits them in showers to plants and animals.</p>

<p>I may trust you, I hope, O Diogenes?</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Thou mayest lower the gods in my presence, as
safely as men in the presence of Timon.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> I would not lower them: I would exalt them.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> More foolish and presumptuous still!</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> Fair words, O Sinopean! I protest to you my aim is
truth.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> I cannot lead thee where of a certainty thou
mayest always find it; but I will tell thee what it is. Truth is
a point; the subtilest and finest; harder than adamant; never
to be broken, worn away, or blunted. Its only bad quality is,
that it is sure to hurt those who touch it; and likely to draw
blood, perhaps the life-blood, of those who press earnestly upon
it. Let us away from this narrow lane skirted with hemlock,
and pursue our road again through the wind and dust toward
the <i>great</i> man and the <i>powerful</i>. Him I would call the powerful
one who controls the storms of his mind, and turns to good
account the worst accidents of his fortune. The great man,
I was going on to demonstrate, is somewhat more. He must
be able to do this, and he must have an intellect which puts
into motion the intellect of others.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> Socrates, then, was your great man.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> He was indeed; nor can all thou hast attributed
to him ever make me think the contrary. I wish he could
have kept a little more at home, and have thought it as well
worth his while to converse with his own children as with others.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> He knew himself born for the benefit of the human race.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Those who are born for the benefit of the human
race go but little into it: those who are born for its curse are
crowded.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> It was requisite to dispel the mists of ignorance and
error.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Has he done it? What doubt has he elucidated,
or what fact has he established? Although I was but twelve
years old and resident in another city when he died, I have
taken some pains in my inquiries about him from persons of
less vanity and less perverseness than his disciples. He did
not leave behind him any true philosopher among them; any
who followed his mode of argumentation, his subjects of
disquisition, or his course of life; any who would subdue the
malignant passions or coerce the looser; any who would abstain
from calumny or from cavil; any who would devote his days to
the glory of his country, or, what is easier and perhaps wiser,
to his own well-founded contentment and well-merited repose.
Xenophon, the best of them, offered up sacrifices, believed in
oracles, consulted soothsayers, turned pale at a jay, and was
dysenteric at a magpie.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> He had courage at least.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> His courage was of so strange a quality, that he
was ready, if jay or magpie did not cross him, to fight for Spartan
or Persian. Plato, whom thou esteemest much, and knowest
somewhat less, careth as little for portent and omen as doth
Diogenes. What he would have done for a Persian I cannot
say; certain I am that he would have no more fought for a
Spartan than he would for his own father: yet he mortally hates
the man who hath a kinder muse or a better milliner, or a seat
nearer the minion of a king. So much for the two disciples of
Socrates who have acquired the greatest celebrity!</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Plato.</i> Diogenes! if you must argue or discourse with me, I
will endure your asperity for the sake of your acuteness; but it
appears to me a more philosophical thing to avoid what is
insulting and vexatious, than to breast and brave it.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Thou hast spoken well.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> It belongs to the vulgar, not to us, to fly from a man&#8217;s
opinions to his actions, and to stab him in his own house for
having received no wound in the school. One merit you will
allow me: I always keep my temper; which you seldom do.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Is mine a good or a bad one?</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> Now, must I speak sincerely?</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Dost thou, a philosopher, ask such a question of
me, a philosopher? Ay, sincerely or not at all.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> Sincerely as you could wish, I must declare, then, your
temper is the worst in the world.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> I am much in the right, therefore, not to keep it.
Embrace me: I have spoken now in thy own manner. Because
thou sayest the most malicious things the most placidly, thou
thinkest or pretendest thou art sincere.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> Certainly those who are most the masters of their
resentments are likely to speak less erroneously than the
passionate and morose.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> If they would, they might; but the moderate are
not usually the most sincere, for the same circumspection which
makes them moderate makes them likewise retentive of what
could give offence: they are also timid in regard to fortune and
favour, and hazard little. There is no mass of sincerity in any
place. What there is must be picked up patiently, a grain or
two at a time; and the season for it is after a storm, after the
overflowing of banks, and bursting of mounds, and sweeping
away of landmarks. Men will always hold something back;
they must be shaken and loosened a little, to make them let go
what is deepest in them, and weightiest and purest.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> Shaking and loosening as much about you as was
requisite for the occasion, it became you to demonstrate where
and in what manner I had made Socrates appear less sagacious
and less eloquent than he was; it became you likewise to consider
the great difficulty of finding new thoughts and new expressions
for those who had more of them than any other men, and to
represent them in all the brilliancy of their wit and in all the
majesty of their genius. I do not assert that I have done it;
but if I have not, what man has? what man has come so nigh
to it? He who could bring Socrates, or Solon, or Diogenes
through a dialogue, without disparagement, is much nearer
in his intellectual powers to them, than any other is near
to him.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Let Diogenes alone, and Socrates, and Solon.
None of the three ever occupied his hours in tingeing and curling
the tarnished plumes of prostitute Philosophy, or deemed anything
worth his attention, care, or notice, that did not make
men brave and independent. As thou callest on me to show
thee where and in what manner thou hast misrepresented thy
teacher, and as thou seemest to set an equal value on eloquence
and on reasoning, I shall attend to thee awhile on each of these
matters, first inquiring of thee whether the axiom is Socratic,
that it is never becoming to get drunk, <i>unless</i> in the solemnities
of Bacchus?</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> This god was the discoverer of the vine and of its
uses.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Is drunkenness one of its uses, or the discovery of
a god? If Pallas or Jupiter hath given us reason, we should
sacrifice our reason with more propriety to Jupiter or Pallas.
To Bacchus is due a libation of wine; the same being his gift,
as thou preachest.</p>

<p>Another and a graver question.</p>

<p>Did Socrates teach thee that &#8216;slaves are to be scourged, and
by no means admonished as though they were the children of
the master&#8217;?</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> He did not argue upon government.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> He argued upon humanity, whereon all government
is founded: whatever is beside it is usurpation.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> Are slaves then never to be scourged, whatever be
their transgressions and enormities?</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Whatever they be, they are less than his who
reduced them to this condition.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> What! though they murder his whole family?</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Ay, and poison the public fountain of the city.</p>

<p>What am I saying? and to whom? Horrible as is this crime,
and next in atrocity to parricide, thou deemest it a lighter one
than stealing a fig or grape. The stealer of these is scourged
by thee; the sentence on the poisoner is to cleanse out the
receptacle. There is, however, a kind of poisoning which, to
do thee justice, comes before thee with all its horrors, and which
thou wouldst punish capitally, even in such a sacred personage
as an aruspex or diviner: I mean the poisoning by incantation.
I, and my whole family, my whole race, my whole city, may bite
the dust in agony from a truss of henbane in the well; and little
harm done forsooth! Let an idle fool set an image of me in
wax before the fire, and whistle and caper to it, and purr and
pray, and chant a hymn to Hecate while it melts, entreating
and imploring her that I may melt as easily&mdash;and thou wouldst,
in thy equity and holiness, strangle him at the first stave of his
psalmody.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> If this is an absurdity, can you find another?</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Truly, in reading thy book, I doubted at first, and
for a long continuance, whether thou couldst have been serious;
and whether it were not rather a satire on those busy-bodies
who are incessantly intermeddling in other people&#8217;s affairs.
It was only on the protestation of thy intimate friends that I
believed thee to have written it in earnest. As for thy question,
it is idle to stoop and pick out absurdities from a mass of
inconsistency and injustice; but another and another I could
throw in, and another and another afterward, from any page in
the volume. Two bare, staring falsehoods lift their beaks one
upon the other, like spring frogs. Thou sayest that no punishment
decreed by the laws tendeth to evil. What! not if
immoderate? not if partial? Why then repeal any penal statute
while the subject of its animadversion exists? In prisons the less
criminal are placed among the more criminal, the inexperienced
in vice together with the hardened in it. This is part of the
punishment, though it precedes the sentence; nay, it is often
inflicted on those whom the judges acquit: the law, by allowing
it, does it.</p>

<p>The next is, that he who is punished by the laws is the better
for it, however the less depraved. What! if anteriorly to the
sentence he lives and converses with worse men, some of whom
console him by deadening the sense of shame, others by removing
the apprehension of punishment? Many laws as certainly make
men bad, as bad men make many laws; yet under thy regimen
they take us from the bosom of the nurse, turn the meat about
upon the platter, pull the bed-clothes off, make us sleep when
we would wake, and wake when we would sleep, and never
cease to rummage and twitch us, until they see us safe landed
at the grave. We can do nothing (but be poisoned) with impunity.
What is worst of all, we must marry certain relatives
and connexions, be they distorted, blear-eyed, toothless, carbuncled,
with hair (if any) eclipsing the reddest torch of Hymen,
and with a hide outrivalling in colour and plaits his trimmest
saffron robe. At the mention of this indeed, friend Plato,
even thou, although resolved to stand out of harm&#8217;s way,
beginnest to make a wry mouth, and findest it difficult to pucker
and purse it up again, without an astringent store of moral
sentences. Hymen is truly no acquaintance of thine. We
know the delicacies of love which thou wouldst reserve for
the gluttony of heroes and the fastidiousness of philosophers.
Heroes, like gods, must have their own way; but against thee
and thy confraternity of elders I would turn the closet-key,
and your mouths might water over, but your tongues should
never enter those little pots of comfiture. Seriously, you who
wear embroidered slippers ought to be very cautious of treading
in the mire. Philosophers should not only live the simplest
lives, but should also use the plainest language. Poets, in
employing magnificent and sonorous words, teach philosophy
the better by thus disarming suspicion that the finest poetry
contains and conveys the finest philosophy. You will never
let any man hold his right station: you would rank Solon with
Homer for poetry. This is absurd. The only resemblance is
in both being eminently wise. Pindar, too, makes even the
cadences of his dithyrambics keep time to the flute of Reason.
My tub, which holds fifty-fold thy wisdom, would crack at the
reverberation of thy voice.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> Farewell.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> I mean that every one of thy whimsies hath been
picked up somewhere by thee in thy travels; and each of them
hath been rendered more weak and puny by its place of concealment
in thy closet. What thou hast written on the immortality
of the soul goes rather to prove the immortality of the body;
and applies as well to the body of a weasel or an eel as to the
fairer one of Agathon or of Aster. Why not at once introduce
a new religion, since religions keep and are relished in proportion
as they are salted with absurdity, inside and out? and all of
them must have one great crystal of it for the centre; but
Philosophy pines and dies unless she drinks limpid water. When
Pherecydes and Pythagoras felt in themselves the majesty of
contemplation, they spurned the idea that flesh and bones and
arteries should confer it: and that what comprehends the past
and the future should sink in a moment and be annihilated for
ever. &#8216;No,&#8217; cried they, &#8216;the power of thinking is no more in
the brain than in the hair, although the brain may be the instrument
on which it plays. It is not corporeal, it is not of this
world; its existence is eternity, its residence is infinity.&#8217; I
forbear to discuss the rationality of their belief, and pass on
straightway to thine; if, indeed, I am to consider as one, belief
and doctrine.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> As you will.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> I should rather, then, regard these things as mere
ornaments; just as many decorate their apartments with lyres
and harps, which they themselves look at from the couch,
supinely complacent, and leave for visitors to admire and play on.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> I foresee not how you can disprove my argument on
the immortality of the soul, which, being contained in the best
of my dialogues, and being often asked for among my friends,
I carry with me.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> At this time?</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> Even so.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Give me then a certain part of it for my perusal.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> Willingly.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Hermes and Pallas! I wanted but a cubit of it,
or at most a fathom, and thou art pulling it out by the plethron.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> This is the place in question.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Read it.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> [<i>Reads.</i>] &#8216;Sayest thou not that death is the opposite
of life, and that they spring the one from the other?&#8217; &#8216;<i>Yes.</i>&#8217;
&#8216;What springs then from the living?&#8217; &#8216;<i>The dead.</i>&#8217; &#8216;And what
from the dead?&#8217; &#8216;<i>The living.</i>&#8217; &#8216;Then all things alive spring
from the dead.&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Why the repetition? but go on.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> [<i>Reads.</i>] &#8216;Souls therefore exist after death in the
infernal regions.&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Where is the <i>therefore</i>? where is it even as to
<i>existence</i>? As to the <i>infernal regions</i>, there is nothing that points
toward a proof, or promises an indication. Death neither springs
from life, nor life from death. Although death is the inevitable
consequence of life, if the observation and experience of ages
go for anything, yet nothing shows us, or ever hath signified,
that life comes from death. Thou mightest as well say that a
barley-corn dies before the germ of another barley-corn grows
up from it, than which nothing is more untrue; for it is only the
protecting part of the germ that perishes, when its protection
is no longer necessary. The consequence, that souls exist after
death, cannot be drawn from the corruption of the body, even
if it were demonstrable that out of this corruption a live one
could rise up. Thou hast not said that the soul is among those
dead things which living things must spring from; thou hast
not said that a living soul produces a dead soul, or that a dead
soul produces a living one.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> No, indeed.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> On my faith, thou hast said, however, things no less
inconsiderate, no less inconsequent, no less unwise; and this
very thing must be said and proved, to make thy argument of
any value. Do dead men beget children?</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> I have not said it.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Thy argument implies it.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> These are high mysteries, and to be approached with
reverence.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Whatever we cannot account for is in the same predicament.
We may be gainers by being ignorant if we can be
thought mysterious. It is better to shake our heads and to let
nothing out of them, than to be plain and explicit in matters
of difficulty. I do not mean in confessing our ignorance or
our imperfect knowledge of them, but in clearing them up
perspicuously: for, if we answer with ease, we may haply be
thought good-natured, quick, communicative; never deep, never
sagacious; not very defective possibly in our intellectual faculties,
yet unequal and chinky, and liable to the probation of every
clown&#8217;s knuckle.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> The brightest of stars appear the most unsteady and
tremulous in their light; not from any quality inherent in themselves,
but from the vapours that float below, and from the
imperfection of vision in the surveyor.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> Draw thy robe round thee; let the folds fall gracefully,
and look majestic. That sentence is an admirable one;
but not for me. I want sense, not stars. What then? Do no
vapours float below the others? and is there no imperfection
in the vision of those who look at <i>them</i>, if they are the same men,
and look the next moment? We must move on: I shall follow
the dead bodies, and the benighted driver of their fantastic
bier, close and keen as any hyena.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> Certainly, O Diogenes, you excel me in elucidations
and similes: mine was less obvious.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Diogenes.</i> I know the respect thou bearest to the dogly
character, and can attribute to nothing else the complacency
with which thou hast listened to me since I released thy cloak.
If ever the Athenians, in their inconstancy, should issue a decree
to deprive me of the appellation they have conferred on me,
rise up, I pray thee, in my defence, and protest that I have not
merited so severe a mulct. Something I do deserve at thy
hands; having supplied thee, first with a store of patience,
when thou wert going without any about thee, although it is
the readiest viaticum and the heartiest sustenance of human
life; and then with weapons from this tub, wherewith to drive
the importunate cock before thee out of doors again.</p>

<h2><a name="ALFIERI_AND_SALOMON_THE_FLORENTINE_JEW" id="ALFIERI_AND_SALOMON_THE_FLORENTINE_JEW"></a>ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW</h2>


<p><i>Alfieri.</i> Let us walk to the window, Signor Salomon. And
now, instead of the silly, simpering compliments repeated at
introductions, let me assure you that you are the only man in
Florence with whom I would willingly exchange a salutation.</p>

<p><i>Salomon.</i> I must think myself highly flattered, Signor Conte,
having always heard that you are not only the greatest democrat,
but also the greatest aristocrat, in Europe.</p>

<p><i>Alfieri.</i> These two things, however opposite, which your smile
would indicate, are not so irreconcilable as you imagine. Let
us first understand the words, and then talk about them. The
democrat is he who wishes the people to have a due share in the
government, and this share if you please shall be the principal
one. The aristocrat of our days is contented with no actual
share in it; but if a man of family is conscious of his dignity,
and resentful that another has invaded it, he may be, and is
universally, called an aristocrat. The principal difference is,
that one carries outward what the other carries inward. I am
thought an aristocrat by the Florentines for conversing with
few people, and for changing my shirt and shaving my beard
on other days than festivals; which the most aristocratical of
them never do, considering it, no doubt, as an excess. I am,
however, from my soul a republican, if prudence and modesty
will authorize any man to call himself so; and this, I trust, I
have demonstrated in the most valuable of my works, the <i>Treatise
on Tyranny</i> and the <i>Dialogue</i> with my friends at Siena. The
aristocratical part of me, if part of me it must be called, hangs
loose and keeps off insects. I see no aristocracy in the children
of sharpers from behind the counter, nor, placing the matter in
the most favourable point of view, in the descendants of free
citizens who accepted from any vile enslaver&mdash;French, Spanish,
German, or priest, or monk (represented with a piece of
buffoonery, like a beehive on his head and a picklock key at
his girdle)&mdash;the titles of counts and marquises. In Piedmont
the matter is different: we must either have been the rabble or
the lords; we were military, and we retain over the populace the
same rank and spirit as our ancestors held over the soldiery.</p>

<p><i>Salomon.</i> Signor Conte, I have heard of levellers, but I have
never seen one: all are disposed to level down, but nobody to
level up. As for nobility, there is none in Europe beside the
Venetian. Nobility must be self-constituted and independent:
the free alone are noble; slavery, like death, levels all. The
English come nearest to the Venetian: they are independent,
but want the main characteristic, the <i>self-constituted</i>. You
have been in England, Signor Conte, and can judge of them
better than I can.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Alfieri.</i> It is among those who stand between the peerage
and the people that there exists a greater mass of virtue and of
wisdom than in the rest of Europe. Much of their dignified
simplicity may be attributed to the plainness of their religion,
and, what will always be imitated, to the decorous life of their
king: for whatever may be the defects of either, if we compare
them with others round us, they are excellent.</p>

<p><i>Salomon.</i> A young religion jumps upon the shoulders of an
older one, and soon becomes like her, by mockery of her tricks,
her cant, and her decrepitude. Meanwhile the old one shakes
with indignation, and swears there is neither relationship nor
likeness. Was there ever a religion in the world that was not
the true religion, or was there ever a king that was not the
best of kings?</p>

<p><i>Alfieri.</i> In the latter case we must have arrived nigh perfection;
since it is evident from the authority of the gravest
men&mdash;theologians, presidents, judges, corporations, universities,
senates&mdash;that every prince is better than his father, &#8216;of blessed
memory, now with God&#8217;. If they continue to rise thus transcendently,
earth in a little time will be incapable of holding them,
and higher heavens must be raised upon the highest heavens
for their reception. The lumber of our Italian courts, the most
crazy part of which is that which rests upon a red cushion in
a gilt chair, with stars and sheep and crosses dangling from
it, must be approached as Artaxerxes and Domitian. These
automatons, we are told nevertheless, are very condescending.
Poor fools who tell us it! ignorant that where on one side is
condescension, on the other side must be baseness. The rascals
have ruined my physiognomy. I wear an habitual sneer upon
my face, God confound them for it! even when I whisper a word
of love in the prone ear of my donna.</p>

<p><i>Salomon.</i> This temper or constitution of mind I am afraid
may do injury to your works.</p>

<p><i>Alfieri.</i> Surely not to all: my satire at least must be the better
for it.</p>

<p><i>Salomon.</i> I think differently. No satire can be excellent
where displeasure is expressed with acrimony and vehemence.
When satire ceases to smile, it should be momentarily, and for
the purpose of inculcating a moral. Juvenal is hardly more
a satirist than Lucan: he is indeed a vigorous and bold declaimer,
but he stamps too often, and splashes up too much filth. We
Italians have no delicacy in wit: we have indeed no conception
of it; we fancy we must be weak if we are not offensive. The
scream of Pulcinello is imitated more easily than the masterly
strokes of Plautus, or the sly insinuations of Catullus and of
Flaccus.</p>

<p><i>Alfieri.</i> We are the least witty of men because we are the most
trifling.</p>

<p><i>Salomon.</i> You would persuade me then that to be witty one
must be grave: this is surely a contradiction.</p>

<p><i>Alfieri.</i> I would persuade you only that banter, pun, and
quibble are the properties of light men and shallow capacities;
that genuine humour and true wit require a sound and capacious
mind, which is always a grave one. Contemptuousness is not
incompatible with them: worthless is that man who feels no
contempt for the worthless, and weak who treats their emptiness
as a thing of weight. At first it may seem a paradox, but it is
perfectly true, that the gravest nations have been the wittiest;
and in those nations some of the gravest men. In England,
Swift and Addison; in Spain, Cervantes. Rabelais and La
Fontaine are recorded by their countrymen to have been
<i>r&ecirc;veurs</i>. Few men have been graver than Pascal; few have
been wittier.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>That Shakespeare was gay and pleasurable in conversation
I can easily admit; for there never was a mind at once so plastic
and so pliant: but without much gravity, could there have been
that potency and comprehensiveness of thought, that depth of
feeling, that creation of imperishable ideas, that sojourn in the
souls of other men? He was amused in his workshop: such was
society. But when he left it, he meditated intensely upon those
limbs and muscles on which he was about to bestow new action,
grace, and majesty; and so great an intensity of meditation
must have strongly impressed his whole character.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Salomon.</i> Certainly no race of men upon earth ever was so
unwarlike, so indifferent to national dignity and to personal
honour, as the Florentines are now: yet in former days a certain
pride, arising from a resemblance in their government to that
of Athens, excited a vivifying desire of approximation where no
danger or loss accompanied it; and Genius was no less confident
of his security than of his power. Look from the window. That
cottage on the declivity was Dante&#8217;s: that square and large
mansion, with a circular garden before it elevated artificially,
was the first scene of Boccaccio&#8217;s <i>Decameron</i>. A boy might
stand at an equal distance between them, and break the windows
of each with his sling. What idle fabricators of crazy systems
will tell me that climate is the creator of genius? The climate
of Austria is more regular and more temperate than ours, which
I am inclined to believe is the most variable in the whole universe,
subject, as you have perceived, to heavy fogs for two months in
winter, and to a stifling heat, concentrated within the hills, for
five more. Yet a single man of genius hath never appeared in
the whole extent of Austria, an extent of several thousand times
greater than our city; and this very street has given birth to fifty.</p>

<p><i>Alfieri.</i> Since the destruction of the republic, Florence has
produced only one great man, Galileo, and abandoned him to
every indignity that fanaticism and despotism could invent.
Extraordinary men, like the stones that are formed in the higher
regions of the air, fall upon the earth only to be broken and cast
into the furnace. The precursor of Newton lived in the deserts
of the moral world, drank water, and ate locusts and wild honey.
It was fortunate that his head also was not lopped off: had a
singer asked it, instead of a dancer, it would have been.</p>

<p><i>Salomon.</i> In fact it was; for the fruits of it were shaken down
and thrown away: he was forbidden to publish the most important
of his discoveries, and the better part of his manuscripts
was burned after his death.</p>

<p><i>Alfieri.</i> Yes, Signor Salomon, those things may rather be
called our heads than this knob above the shoulder, of which
(as matters stand) we are rather the porters than the proprietors,
and which is really the joint concern of barber and dentist.</p>

<p><i>Salomon.</i> Our thoughts, if they may not rest at home, may
wander freely. Delighting in the remoter glories of my native
city, I forget at times its humiliation and ignominy. A town
so little that the voice of a cabbage-girl in the midst of it may
be heard at the extremities, reared within three centuries a
greater number of citizens illustrious for their genius than all
the remainder of the Continent (excepting her sister Athens)
in six thousand years. My ignorance of the Greek forbids me
to compare our Dante with Homer. The propriety and force
of language and the harmony of verse in the glorious Grecian
are quite lost to me. Dante had not only to compose a poem,
but in great part a language. Fantastical as the plan of his
poem is, and, I will add, uninteresting and uninviting; unimportant,
mean, contemptible, as are nine-tenths of his characters
and his details, and wearisome as is the scheme of his versification&mdash;there
are more thoughts highly poetical, there is more
reflection, and the nobler properties of mind and intellect are
brought into more intense action, not only than in the whole
course of French poetry, but also in the whole of continental;
nor do I think (I must here also speak with hesitation) that any
one drama of Shakespeare contains so many. Smile as you will,
Signor Conte, what must I think of a city where Michel Angelo,
Frate Bartolomeo, Ghiberti (who formed them), Guicciardini,
and Machiavelli were secondary men? And certainly such
were they, if we compare them with Galileo and Boccaccio and
Dante.</p>

<p><i>Alfieri.</i> I smiled from pure delight, which I rarely do; for I
take an interest deep and vital in such men, and in those who
appreciate them rightly and praise them unreservedly. These
are my fellow-citizens: I acknowledge no other; we are of the
same tribe, of the same household; I bow to them as being older
than myself, and I love them as being better.</p>

<p><i>Salomon.</i> Let us hope that our Italy is not yet effete. Filangieri
died but lately: what think you of him?</p>

<p><i>Alfieri.</i> If it were possible that I could ever see his statue in
a square at Constantinople, though I should be scourged for an
idolater, I would kiss the pedestal. As this, however, is less
likely than that I should suffer for writing satirically, and as
criticism is less likely to mislead me than speculation, I will
revert to our former subject.</p>

<p>Indignation and contempt may be expressed in other poems
than such as are usually called satires. Filicaia, in his celebrated
address to Italy, steers a middle course.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>A perfect piece of criticism must exhibit <i>where</i> a work is good
or bad; <i>why</i> it is good or bad; in what degree it is good or bad;
must also demonstrate in what manner, and to what extent,
the same ideas or reflections have come to others, and, if they
be clothed in poetry, why by an apparently slight variation,
what in one author is mediocrity, in another is excellence. I
have never seen a critic of Florence, or Pisa, or Milan, or Bologna,
who did not commend and admire the sonnet of Cassiani on the
rape of Proserpine, without a suspicion of its manifold and
grave defects.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>Does not this describe the devils of our carnival, rather than
the majestic brother of Jupiter, at whose side upon asphodel
and amaranth the sweet Persephone sits pensively contented,
in that deep motionless quiet which mortals pity and which
the gods enjoy; rather than him who, under the umbrage of
Elysium, gazes at once upon all the beauties that on earth were
separated&mdash;Helena and Eriphyle, Polyxena and Hermione,
Deidamia and Deianira, Leda and Omphale, Atalanta and
Cydippe, Laodamia, with her arm round the neck of a fond
youth whom she still seems afraid of losing, and, apart, the
daughters of Niobe clinging to their parent?</p>

<p><i>Salomon.</i> These images are better than satires; but continue,
in preference to other thoughts or pursuits, the noble career
you have entered. Be contented, Signor Conte, with the glory
of our first great dramatist, and neglect altogether any inferior
one. Why vex and torment yourself about the French? They
buzz and are troublesome while they are swarming; but the
master will soon hive them. Is the whole nation worth the
worst of your tragedies? All the present race of them, all the
creatures in the world which excite your indignation, will lie in
the grave, while young and old are clapping their hands or beating
their bosoms at your <i>Bruto Primo</i>. Consider also that kings
and emperors should in your estimation be but as grasshoppers
and beetles: let them consume a few blades of your clover without
molesting them, without bringing them to crawl on you and claw
you. The difference between them and men of genius is almost
as great as between men of genius and those higher intelligences
who act in immediate subordination to the Almighty. Yes,
I assert it, without flattery and without fear, the angels are not
higher above mortals than you are above the proudest that
trample on them.</p>

<p><i>Alfieri.</i> I believe, sir, you were the first in commending my
tragedies.</p>

<p><i>Salomon.</i> He who first praises a good book becomingly is
next in merit to the author.</p>

<p><i>Alfieri.</i> As a writer and as a man I know my station: if I
found in the world five equal to myself, I would walk out of it,
not to be jostled.</p>

<p>I must now, Signor Salomon, take my leave of you; for his
Eminence my coachman and their Excellencies my horses are
waiting.</p>

<h2><a name="ROUSSEAU_AND_MALESHERBES" id="ROUSSEAU_AND_MALESHERBES"></a>ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES</h2>


<p><i>Rousseau.</i> I am ashamed, sir, of my countrymen: let my
humiliation expiate their offence. I wish it had not been a
minister of the Gospel who received you with such inhospitality.</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> Nothing can be more ardent and more cordial
than the expressions with which you greet me, M. Rousseau,
on my return from your lakes and mountains.</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> If the pastor took you for a courtier, I reverence
him for his contemptuousness.</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> Why so? Indeed you are in the wrong, my
friend. No person has a right to treat another with contemptuousness
unless he knows him to deserve it. When a
courtier enters the house of a pastor in preference to the next,
the pastor should partake in the sentiment that induced him,
or at least not to be offended to be preferred. A courtier is
such at court: in the house of a clergyman he is not a courtier,
but a guest. If to be a courtier is offensive, remember that we
punish offences where they are committed, where they can be
examined, where pleadings can be heard for and against the
accused, and where nothing is admitted extraneous from the
indictment, excepting what may be adduced in his behalf by
witnesses to the general tenor of his character.</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> Is it really true that the man told you to mount
the hayloft if you wished a night&#8217;s lodging?</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> He did: a certain proof that he no more took
me to be a courtier than I took him to be. I accepted his offer,
and never slept so soundly. Moderate fatigue, the Alpine air,
the blaze of a good fire (for I was admitted to it some moments),
and a profusion of odoriferous hay, below which a cow was
sleeping, subdued my senses, and protracted my slumbers
beyond the usual hour.</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> You have no right, sir, to be the patron and remunerator
of inhospitality. Three or four such men as you
would corrupt all Switzerland, and prepare it for the fangs of
France and Austria. Kings, like hyenas, will always fall upon
dead carcasses, although their bellies are full, and although they
are conscious that in the end they will tear one another to
pieces over them. Why should you prepare their prey? Were
your fire and effulgence given you for this? Why, in short,
did you thank this churl? Why did you recommend him to his
superiors for preferment on the next vacancy?</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> I must adopt your opinion of his behaviour in
order to answer you satisfactorily. You suppose him inhospitable:
what milder or more effectual mode of reproving him, than
to make every dish at his table admonish him? If he did evil,
have I no authority before me which commands me to render
him good for it? Believe me, M. Rousseau, the execution of
this command is always accompanied by the heart&#8217;s applause,
and opportunities of obedience are more frequent here than
anywhere. Would not you exchange resentment for the contrary
feeling, even if religion or duty said nothing about the matter?
I am afraid the most philosophical of us are sometimes a little
perverse, and will not be so happy as they might be, because
the path is pointed out to them, and because he who points it
out is wise and powerful. Obstinacy and jealousy, the worst
parts of childhood and of manhood, have range enough for their
ill humours without the heavens.</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> Sir, I perceive you are among my enemies. I
did not think it; for, whatever may be my faults, I am totally
free from suspicion.</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> And do not think it now, I entreat you, my good
friend.</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> Courts and society have corrupted the best heart
in France, and have perverted the best intellect.</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> They have done much evil then.</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> Answer me, and your own conscience: how could
you choose to live among the perfidies of Paris and Versailles?</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> Lawyers, and advocates in particular, must live
there; philosophers need not. If every honest man thought it
requisite to leave those cities, would the inhabitants be the
better?</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> You have entered into intimacies with the members
of various administrations, opposite in plans and sentiments,
but alike hostile to you, and all of whom, if they could have kept
your talents down, would have done it. Finding the thing
impossible, they ceased to persecute, and would gladly tempt
you under the semblance of friendship and esteem to supplicate
for some office, that they might indicate to the world your
unworthiness by refusing you: a proof, as you know, quite
sufficient and self-evident.</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> They will never tempt me to supplicate for
anything but justice, and that in behalf of others. I know
nothing of parties. If I am acquainted with two persons of
opposite sides in politics, I consider them as you consider a
watchmaker and a cabinet-maker: one desires to rise by one
way, the other by another. Administrations and systems of
government would be quite indifferent to those very functionaries
and their opponents, who appear the most zealous partisans, if
their fortunes and consequence were not affixed to them.
Several of these men seem consistent, and indeed are; the reason
is, versatility would loosen and detach from them the public
esteem and confidence&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> By which their girandoles are lighted, their dinners
served, their lackeys liveried, and their opera-girls vie in
benefit-nights. There is no State in Europe where the least
wise have not governed the most wise. We find the light and
foolish keeping up with the machinery of government easily
and leisurely, just as we see butterflies keep up with carriages
at full speed. This is owing in both cases to their levity and their
position: the stronger and the more active are left behind. I
am resolved to prove that farmers-general are the main causes
of the defects in our music.</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> Prove it, or anything else, provided that the
discussion does not irritate and torment you.</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> Truth is the object of philosophy.</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> Not of philosophers: the display of ingenuity,
for the most part, is and always has been it. I must here offer
you an opinion of my own, which, if you think well of me, you will
pardon, though you should disbelieve its solidity. My opinion
then is, that truth is not reasonably the main and ultimate
object of philosophy; but that philosophy should seek truth
merely as the means of acquiring and of propagating happiness.
Truths are simple; wisdom, which is formed by their apposition
and application, is concrete: out of this, in its vast varieties,
open to our wants and wishes, comes happiness. But the knowledge
of all the truths ever yet discovered does not lead immediately
to it, nor indeed will ever reach it, unless you make the
more important of them bear upon your heart and intellect,
and form, as it were, the blood that moves and nurtures them.</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> I never until now entertained a doubt that truth is
the ultimate aim and object of philosophy: no writer has
denied it, I think.</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> Designedly none may: but when it is agreed
that happiness is the chief good, it must also be agreed that the
chief wisdom will pursue it; and I have already said, what your
own experience cannot but have pointed out to you, that no
truth, or series of truths, hypothetically, can communicate or
attain it. Come, M. Rousseau, tell me candidly, do you derive no
pleasure from a sense of superiority in genius and independence?</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> The highest, sir, from a consciousness of
independence.</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> <i>Ingenuous</i> is the epithet we affix to modesty,
but modesty often makes men act otherwise than ingenuously:
you, for example, now. You are angry at the servility of
people, and disgusted at their obtuseness and indifference, on
matters of most import to their welfare. If they were equal
to you, this anger would cease; but the fire would break out
somewhere else, on ground which appears at present sound and
level. Voltaire, for instance, is less eloquent than you: but
Voltaire is wittier than any man living. This quality&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> Is the quality of a buffoon and a courtier. But
the buffoon should have most of it, to support his higher dignity.</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> Voltaire&#8217;s is Attic.</p>

<p><i>Rousseau</i>. If malignity is Attic. Petulance is not wit,
although a few grains of wit may be found in petulance: quartz
is not gold, although a few grains of gold may be found in
quartz. Voltaire is a monkey in mischief, and a spaniel in
obsequiousness. He declaims against the cruel and tyrannical;
and he kisses the hands of adulteresses who murder their
husbands, and of robbers who decimate their gang.</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> I will not discuss with you the character of the
man, and only that part of the author&#8217;s on which I spoke.
There may be malignity in wit, there cannot be violence. You
may irritate and disquiet with it; but it must be by means of a
flower or a feather. Wit and humour stand on one side, irony
and sarcasm on the other.</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> They are in near neighbourhood.</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> So are the Elysian fields and Tartarus.</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> Pray, go on: teach me to stand quiet in my stall,
while my masters and managers pass by.</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> Well then&mdash;Pascal argues as closely and methodically;
Bossuet is as scientific in the structure of his sentences;
Demosthenes, many think, has equal fire, vigour, dexterity:
equal selection of topics and equal temperance in treating
them, immeasurably as he falls short of you in appeals to the
sensibility, and in everything which by way of excellence we
usually call genius.</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> Sir, I see no resemblance between a pleader at
the bar, or a haranguer of the populace, and me.</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> Certainly his questions are occasional: but one
great question hangs in the centre, and high above the rest;
and this is, whether the Mother of liberty and civilization shall
exist, or whether she shall be extinguished in the bosom of her
family. As we often apply to Eloquence and her parts the
terms we apply to Architecture and hers, let me do it also, and
remark that nothing can be more simple, solid, and symmetrical,
nothing more frugal in decoration or more appropriate in distribution,
than the apartments of Demosthenes. Yours excel
them in space and altitude; your ornaments are equally chaste
and beautiful, with more variety and invention, more airiness
and light. But why, among the Loves and Graces, does Apollo
flay Marsyas?&mdash;and why may not the tiara still cover the ears
of Midas? Cannot you, who detest kings and courtiers, keep
away from them? If I must be with them, let me be in good
humour and good spirits. If I will tread upon a Persian carpet,
let it at least be in clean shoes.</p>

<p>As the raciest wine makes the sharpest vinegar, so the richest
fancies turn the most readily to acrimony. Keep yours, my dear
M. Rousseau, from the exposure and heats that generate it.
Be contented; enjoy your fine imagination; and do not throw
your salad out of window, nor shove your cat off your knee, on
hearing it said that Shakespeare has a finer, or that a minister
is of opinion that you know more of music than of state. My
friend! the quarrels of ingenious men are generally far less
reasonable and just, less placable and moderate, than those of
the stupid and ignorant. We ought to blush at this: and we
should blush yet more deeply if we bring them in as parties to
our differences. Let us conquer by kindness; which we cannot
do easily or well without communication.</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> The minister would expel me from his antechamber,
and order his valets to buffet me, if I offered him any proposal
for the advantage of mankind.</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> Call to him, then, from this room, where the
valets are civiler. Nature has given you a speaking-trumpet,
which neither storm can drown nor enemy can silence. If you
esteem him, instruct him; if you despise him, do the same.
Surely, you who have much benevolence would not despise any
one willingly or unnecessarily. Contempt is for the incorrigible:
now, where upon earth is he whom your genius, if rightly and
temperately exerted, would not influence and correct?</p>

<p>I never was more flattered or honoured than by your patience
in listening to me. Consider me as an old woman who sits by
the bedside in your infirmity, who brings you no savoury
viand, no exotic fruit, but a basin of whey or a basket of strawberries
from your native hills; assures you that what oppressed
you was a dream, occasioned by the wrong position in which
you lay; opens the window, gives you fresh air, and entreats
you to recollect the features of Nature, and to observe (which
no man ever did so accurately) their beauty. In your politics
you cut down a forest to make a toothpick, and cannot make
even that out of it! Do not let us in jurisprudence be like
critics in the classics, and change whatever can be changed,
right or wrong. No statesman will take your advice. Supposing
that any one is liberal in his sentiments and clear-sighted
in his views, nevertheless love of power is jealous, and he would
rejoice to see you fleeing from persecution or turning to meet it.
The very men whom you would benefit will treat you worse.
As the ministers of kings wish their masters to possess absolute
power that the exercise of it may be delegated to them, which
it naturally is from the violence and sloth alternate with despots
as with wild beasts, and that they may apprehend no check or
control from those who discover their misdemeanours, in like
manner the people places more trust in favour than in fortune,
and hopes to obtain by subserviency what it never might by
election or by chance. Else in free governments, so some are
called (for names once given are the last things lost), all minor
offices and employments would be assigned by ballot. Each
province or canton would present a list annually of such persons
in it as are worthy to occupy the local administrations.</p>

<p>To avoid any allusion to the country in which we live, let us
take England for example. Is it not absurd, iniquitous, and
revolting, that the minister of a church in Yorkshire should be
appointed by a lawyer in London, who never knew him, never
saw him, never heard from a single one of the parishioners a
recommendation of any kind? Is it not more reasonable that a
justice of the peace should be chosen by those who have always
been witnesses of his integrity?</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> The king should appoint his ministers, and should
invest them with power and splendour; but those ministers
should not appoint to any civil or religious place of trust or
profit which the community could manifestly fill better. The
greater part of offices and dignities should be conferred for a
short and stated time, that all might hope to attain and strive
to deserve them. Embassies in particular should never exceed
one year in Europe, nor consulates two. To the latter office I
assign this duration as the more difficult to fulfil properly, from
requiring a knowledge of trade, although a slight one, and
because those who possess any such knowledge are inclined for
the greater part to turn it to their own account, which a consul
ought by no means to do. Frequent election of representatives
and of civil officers in the subordinate employments would
remove most causes of discontent in the people, and of instability
in kingly power. Here is a lottery in which every one
is sure of a prize, if not for himself, at least for somebody in
his family or among his friends; and the ticket would be fairly
paid for out of the taxes.</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> So it appears to me. What other system can
present so obviously to the great mass of the people the two
principal piers and buttresses of government, tangible interest
and reasonable hope? No danger of any kind can arise from it,
no antipathies, no divisions, no imposture of demagogues, no
caprice of despots. On the contrary, many and great advantages
in places which at the first survey do not appear to border
on it. At present, the best of the English juridical institutions,
that of justices of the peace, is viewed with diffidence and distrust.
Elected as they would be, and increased in number, the
whole judicature, civil and criminal, might be confided to them,
and their labours be not only not aggravated but diminished.
Suppose them in four divisions to meet at four places in every
county once in twenty days, and to possess the power of imposing
a fine not exceeding two hundred francs on every cause implying
oppression, and one not exceeding fifty on such as they should
unanimously declare frivolous.</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> Few would become attorneys, and those from
among the indigent.</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> Almost the greatest evil that exists in the
world, moral or physical, would be removed. A second appeal
might be made in the following session; a third could only come
before Parliament, and this alone by means of attorneys, the
number of whom altogether would not exceed the number of
coroners; for in England there are as many who cut their own
throats as who would cut their own purses.</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> The famous <i>trial by jury</i> would cease: this would
disgust the English.</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> The number of justices would be much augmented:
nearly all those who now are jurymen would enjoy
this rank and dignity, and would be flattered by sitting on the
same bench with the first gentlemen of the land.</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> What number would sit?</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> Three or five in the first instance; five or seven
in the second&mdash;as the number of causes should permit.</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> The laws of England are extremely intricate and
perplexed: such men would be puzzled.</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> Such men having no interest in the perplexity,
but on the contrary an interest in unravelling it, would see such
laws corrected. Intricate as they are, questions on those which
are the most so are usually referred by the judges themselves
to private arbitration; of which my plan, I conceive, has all
the advantages, united to those of open and free discussion
among men of unperverted sense, and unbiased by professional
hopes and interests. The different courts of law in England
cost about seventy millions of francs annually. On my system,
the justices or judges would receive five-and-twenty francs
daily; as the <i>special jurymen</i> do now, without any sense of
shame or impropriety, however rich they may be: such being
the established practice.</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> Seventy millions! seventy millions!</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> There are attorneys and conveyancers in London
who gain one hundred thousand francs a year, and advocates
more. The chancellor&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> The Celeno of these harpies&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> Nets above one million, and is greatly more than
an archbishop in the Church, scattering preferment in Cumberland
and Cornwall from his bench at Westminster.</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> Absurdities and enormities are great in proportion
to custom or insuetude. If we had lived from childhood with
a boa constrictor, we should think it no more a monster than a
canary-bird. The sum you mentioned, of seventy millions, is
incredible.</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> In this estimate the expense of letters by the
post, and of journeys made by the parties, is not and cannot
be included.</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> The whole machine of government, civil and
religious, ought never to bear upon the people with a weight so
oppressive. I do not add the national defence, which being
principally naval is more costly, nor institutions for the promotion
of the arts, which in a country like England ought to
be liberal. But such an expenditure should nearly suffice for
these also, in time of peace. Religion and law indeed should
cost nothing: at present the one hangs property, the other
quarters it. I am confounded at the profusion. I doubt
whether the Romans expended so much in that year&#8217;s war
which dissolved the Carthaginian empire, and left them masters
of the universe. What is certain, and what is better, it did not
cost a tenth of it to colonize Pennsylvania, in whose forests
the cradle of freedom is suspended, and where the eye of philanthropy,
tired with tears and vigils, may wander and may rest.
Your system, or rather your arrangement of one already established,
pleases me. Ministers would only lose thereby that
portion of their possessions which they give away to needy
relatives, unworthy dependants, or the requisite supporters of
their authority and power.</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> On this plan, no such supporters would be
necessary, no such dependants could exist, and no such relatives
could be disappointed. Beside, the conflicts of their opponents
must be periodical, weak, and irregular.</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> The craving for the rich carrion would be less keen;
the zeal of opposition, as usual, would be measured by the
stomach, whereon hope and overlooking have always a strong
influence.</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> My excellent friend, do not be offended with me
for an ingenuous and frank confession: promise me your pardon.</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> You need none.</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> Promise it, nevertheless.</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> You have said nothing, done nothing, which could
in any way displease me.</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> You grant me, then, a bill of indemnity for
what I may have undertaken with a good intention since we
have been together?</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> Willingly.</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> I fell into your views, I walked along with you
side by side, merely to occupy your mind, which I perceived
was agitated.</p>

<p>In compliance with your humour, to engage your fancy, to
divert it awhile from Switzerland, by which you appear and
partly on my account to be offended, I began with reflections
upon England: I raised up another cloud in the region of them,
light enough to be fantastic and diaphanous, and to catch some
little irradiation from its western sun. Do not run after it
farther; it has vanished already. Consider: the three great
nations&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> Pray, which are those?</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> I cannot in conscience give the palm to the
Hottentots, the Greenlanders, or the Hurons: I meant to
designate those who united to empire the most social virtue
and civil freedom. Athens, Rome, and England have received
on the subject of government elaborate treatises from their
greatest men. You have reasoned more dispassionately and
profoundly on it than Plato has done, or probably than Cicero,
led away as he often is by the authority of those who are inferior
to himself: but do you excel Aristoteles in calm and patient
investigation? Or, think you, are your reading and range of
thought more extensive than Harrington&#8217;s and Milton&#8217;s? Yet
what effect have the political works of these marvellous men
produced upon the world?&mdash;what effect upon any one state,
any one city, any one hamlet? A clerk in office, an accountant,
a gauger of small beer, a songwriter for a tavern dinner, produces
more. He thrusts his rags into the hole whence the wind
comes, and sleeps soundly. While you and I are talking about
elevations and proportions, pillars and pilasters, architraves
and friezes, the buildings we should repair are falling to the
earth, and the materials for their restoration are in the quarry.</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> I could answer you: but my mind has certain
moments of repose, or rather of oscillation, which I would not
for the world disturb. Music, eloquence, friendship, bring and
prolong them.</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> Enjoy them, my dear friend, and convert them
if possible to months and years. It is as much at your arbitration
on what theme you shall meditate, as in what meadow you
shall botanize; and you have as much at your option the choice
of your thoughts, as of the keys in your harpsichord.</p>

<p><i>Rousseau.</i> If this were true, who could be unhappy?</p>

<p><i>Malesherbes.</i> Those of whom it is not true. Those who from
want of practice cannot manage their thoughts, who have few
to select from, and who, because of their sloth or of their weakness,
do not roll away the heaviest from before them.</p>

<h2><a name="LUCULLUS_AND_CAESAR" id="LUCULLUS_AND_CAESAR"></a>LUCULLUS AND CAESAR</h2>


<p><i>Caesar.</i> Lucius Lucullus, I come to you privately and unattended
for reasons which you will know; confiding, I dare not
say in your friendship, since no service of mine toward you hath
deserved it, but in your generous and disinterested love of
peace. Hear me on. Cneius Pompeius, according to the
report of my connexions in the city, had, on the instant of my
leaving it for the province, begun to solicit his dependants to
strip me ignominiously of authority. Neither vows nor affinity
can bind him. He would degrade the father of his wife; he
would humiliate his own children, the unoffending, the unborn;
he would poison his own nascent love&mdash;at the suggestion of
Ambition. Matters are now brought so far, that either he or I
must submit to a reverse of fortune; since no concession can
assuage his malice, divert his envy, or gratify his cupidity.
No sooner could I raise myself up, from the consternation and
stupefaction into which the certainty of these reports had
thrown me, than I began to consider in what manner my own
private afflictions might become the least noxious to the republic.
Into whose arms, then, could I throw myself more naturally
and more securely, to whose bosom could I commit and consign
more sacredly the hopes and destinies of our beloved country,
than his who laid down power in the midst of its enjoyments,
in the vigour of youth, in the pride of triumph, when Dignity
solicited, when Friendship urged, entreated, supplicated, and
when Liberty herself invited and beckoned to him from the
senatorial order and from the curule chair? Betrayed and
abandoned by those we had confided in, our next friendship,
if ever our hearts receive any, or if any will venture in those
places of desolation, flies forward instinctively to what is
most contrary and dissimilar. Caesar is hence the visitant of
Lucullus.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> I had always thought Pompeius more moderate
and more reserved than you represent him, Caius Julius; and
yet I am considered in general, and surely you also will consider
me, but little liable to be prepossessed by him.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> Unless he may have ingratiated himself with you
recently, by the administration of that worthy whom last winter
his partisans dragged before the Senate, and forced to assert
publicly that you and Cato had instigated a party to circumvent
and murder him; and whose carcass, a few days afterward,
when it had been announced that he had died by a natural
death, was found covered with bruises, stabs, and dislocations.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> You bring much to my memory which had quite
slipped out of it, and I wonder that it could make such an
impression on yours. A proof to me that the interest you take
in my behalf began earlier than your delicacy will permit you
to acknowledge. You are fatigued, which I ought to have
perceived before.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> Not at all; the fresh air has given me life and alertness:
I feel it upon my cheek even in the room.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> After our dinner and sleep, we will spend the
remainder of the day on the subject of your visit.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> Those Ethiopian slaves of yours shiver with cold
upon the mountain here; and truly I myself was not insensible
to the change of climate, in the way from Mutina.</p>

<p>What white bread! I never found such even at Naples or
Capua. This Formian wine (which I prefer to the Chian), how
exquisite!</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> Such is the urbanity of Caesar, even while he bites
his lip with displeasure. How! surely it bleeds! Permit me
to examine the cup.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> I believe a jewel has fallen out of the rim in the
carriage: the gold is rough there.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> Marcipor, let me never see that cup again! No
answer, I desire. My guest pardons heavier faults. Mind that
dinner be prepared for us shortly.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> In the meantime, Lucullus, if your health permits it,
shall we walk a few paces round the villa? for I have not seen
anything of the kind before.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> The walls are double; the space between them two
feet: the materials for the most part earth and straw. Two
hundred slaves, and about as many mules and oxen, brought
the beams and rafters up the mountain; my architects fixed
them at once in their places: every part was ready, even the
wooden nails. The roof is thatched, you see.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> Is there no danger that so light a material should
be carried off by the winds, on such an eminence?</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> None resists them equally well.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> On this immensely high mountain, I should be
apprehensive of the lightning, which the poets, and I think the
philosophers too, have told us strikes the highest.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> The poets are right; for whatever is received as
truth is truth in poetry; and a fable may illustrate like a fact.
But the philosophers are wrong, as they generally are, even in
the commonest things; because they seldom look beyond their
own tenets, unless through captiousness, and because they
argue more than they meditate, and display more than they
examine. Archimedes and Euclid are, in my opinion, after our
Epicurus, the worthiest of the name, having kept apart to the
demonstrable, the practical, and the useful. Many of the
rest are good writers and good disputants; but unfaithful
suitors of simple science, boasters of their acquaintance with
gods and goddesses, plagiarists and impostors. I had forgotten
my roof, although it is composed of much the same materials
as the philosophers&#8217;. Let the lightning fall: one handful of
silver, or less, repairs the damage.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> Impossible! nor indeed one thousand, nor twenty, if
those tapestries and pictures are consumed.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> True; but only the thatch would burn. For,
before the baths were tessellated, I filled the area with alum and
water, and soaked the timbers and laths for many months, and
covered them afterward with alum in powder, by means of
liquid glue. Mithridates taught me this. Having in vain
attacked with combustibles a wooden tower, I took it by
stratagem, and found within it a mass of alum, which, if a great
hurry had not been observed by us among the enemy in the
attempt to conceal it, would have escaped our notice. I never
scrupled to extort the truth from my prisoners; but my instruments
were purple robes and plate, and the only wheel in my
armoury destined to such purposes was the wheel of Fortune.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> I wish, in my campaigns, I could have equalled your
clemency and humanity; but the Gauls are more uncertain,
fierce, and perfidious than the wildest tribes of Caucasus; and
our policy cannot be carried with us, it must be formed upon
the spot. They love you, not for abstaining from hurting
them, but for ceasing; and they embrace you only at two
seasons&mdash;when stripes are fresh, or when stripes are imminent.
Elsewhere, I hope to become the rival of Lucullus in this
admirable part of virtue.</p>

<p>I shall never build villas, because&mdash;but what are your proportions?
Surely the edifice is extremely low.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> There is only one floor; the height of the apartments
is twenty feet to the cornice, five above it; the breadth is
twenty-five, the length forty. The building, as you perceive,
is quadrangular: three sides contain four rooms each; the other
has many partitions and two stories, for domestics and offices.
Here is my salt-bath.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> A bath, indeed, for all the Nereids named by Hesiod,
with room enough for the Tritons and their herds and horses.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> Here stand my two cows. Their milk is brought
to me with its warmth and froth; for it loses its salubrity both
by repose and by motion. Pardon me, Caesar: I shall appear to
you to have forgotten that I am not conducting Marcus Varro.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> You would convert him into Cacus: he would drive
them off. What beautiful beasts! how sleek and white and
cleanly! I never saw any like them, excepting when we
sacrifice to Jupiter the stately leader from the pastures of
the Clitumnus.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> Often do I make a visit to these quiet creatures,
and with no less pleasure than in former days to my horses.
Nor indeed can I much wonder that whole nations have been
consentaneous in treating them as objects of devotion: the only
thing wonderful is that gratitude seems to have acted as powerfully
and extensively as fear; indeed, more extensively, for no
object of worship whatever has attracted so many worshippers.
Where Jupiter has one, the cow has ten: she was venerated
before he was born, and will be when even the carvers have
forgotten him.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> Unwillingly should I see it; for the character of our
gods hath formed the character of our nation. Serapis and
Isis have stolen in among them within our memory, and others
will follow, until at last Saturn will not be the only one emasculated
by his successor. What can be more august than our
rites? The first dignitaries of the republic are emulous to
administer them: nothing of low or venal has any place in them;
nothing pusillanimous, nothing unsocial and austere. I speak
of them as they were; before Superstition woke up again from
her slumber, and caught to her bosom with maternal love the
alluvial monsters of the Nile. Philosophy, never fit for the
people, had entered the best houses, and the image of Epicurus
had taken the place of the Lemures. But men cannot bear to
be deprived long together of anything they are used to, not
even of their fears; and, by a reaction of the mind appertaining
to our nature, new stimulants were looked for, not on the side
of pleasure, where nothing new could be expected or imagined,
but on the opposite. Irreligion is followed by fanaticism, and
fanaticism by irreligion, alternately and perpetually.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> The religion of our country, as you observe, is well
adapted to its inhabitants. Our progenitor, Mars, hath Venus
recumbent on his breast and looking up to him, teaching us that
pleasure is to be sought in the bosom of valour and by the means
of war. No great alteration, I think, will ever be made in our
rites and ceremonies&mdash;the best and most imposing that could
be collected from all nations, and uniting them to us by our
complacence in adopting them. The gods themselves may
change names, to flatter new power: and, indeed, as we degenerate,
Religion will accommodate herself to our propensities and
desires. Our heaven is now popular: it will become monarchal;
not without a crowded court, as befits it, of apparitors and
satellites and minions of both sexes, paid and caressed for carrying
to their stern, dark-bearded master prayers and supplications.
Altars must be strown with broken minds, and incense rise
amid abject aspirations. Gods will be found unfit for their
places; and it is not impossible that, in the ruin imminent
from our contentions for power, and in the necessary extinction
both of ancient families and of generous sentiments, our consular
fasces may become the water-sprinklers of some upstart priesthood,
and that my son may apply for lustration to the son of my
groom. The interest of such men requires that the spirit of
arms and of arts be extinguished. They will predicate peace,
that the people may be tractable to them; but a religion altogether
pacific is the fomenter of wars and the nurse of crimes,
alluring Sloth from within and Violence from afar. If ever it
should prevail among the Romans, it must prevail alone: for
nations more vigorous and energetic will invade them, close
upon them, trample them under foot; and the name of Roman,
which is now the most glorious, will become the most opprobrious
upon earth.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> The time, I hope, may be distant; for next to my own
name I hold my country&#8217;s.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> Mine, not coming from Troy or Ida, is lower in
my estimation: I place my country&#8217;s first.</p>

<p>You are surveying the little lake beside us. It contains no
fish, birds never alight on it, the water is extremely pure and
cold; the walk round is pleasant, not only because there is
always a gentle breeze from it, but because the turf is fine
and the surface of the mountain on this summit is perfectly on
a level to a great extent in length&mdash;not a trifling advantage to
me, who walk often and am weak. I have no alley, no garden,
no enclosure; the park is in the vale below, where a brook
supplies the ponds, and where my servants are lodged; for here
I have only twelve in attendance.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> What is that so white, towards the Adriatic?</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> The Adriatic itself. Turn round and you may
descry the Tuscan Sea. Our situation is reported to be among
the highest of the Apennines. Marcipor has made the sign to
me that dinner is ready. Pass this way.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> What a library is here! Ah, Marcus Tullius! I salute
thy image. Why frownest thou upon me&mdash;collecting the
consular robe and uplifting the right arm, as when Rome stood
firm again, and Catiline fled before thee?</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> Just so; such was the action the statuary chose, as
adding a new endearment to the memory of my absent friend.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> Sylla, who honoured you above all men, is not here.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> I have his <i>Commentaries</i>: he inscribed them, as
you know, to me. Something even of our benefactors may be
forgotten, and gratitude be unreproved.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> The impression on that couch, and the two fresh
honeysuckles in the leaves of those two books, would show,
even to a stranger, that this room is peculiarly the master&#8217;s.
Are they sacred?</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> To me and Caesar.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> I would have asked permission&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> Caius Julius, you have nothing to ask of Polybius
and Thucydides; nor of Xenophon, the next to them on the
table.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> Thucydides! the most generous, the most unprejudiced,
the most sagacious, of historians. Now, Lucullus,
you whose judgment in style is more accurate than any other
Roman&#8217;s, do tell me whether a commander, desirous of writing
his <i>Commentaries</i>, could take to himself a more perfect model
than Thucydides?</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> Nothing is more perfect, nor ever will be: the scholar
of Pericles, the master of Demosthenes, the equal of the one in
military science, and of the other not the inferior in civil and
forensic; the calm dispassionate judge of the general by whom
he was defeated, his defender, his encomiast. To talk of such
men is conducive not only to virtue but to health.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>This other is my dining-room. You expect the dishes.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> I misunderstood&mdash;I fancied&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> Repose yourself, and touch with the ebony wand,
beside you, the sphinx on either of those obelisks, right or left.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> Let me look at them first.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> The contrivance was intended for one person, or
two at most, desirous of privacy and quiet. The blocks of
jasper in my pair, and of porphyry in yours, easily yield in their
grooves, each forming one partition. There are four, containing
four platforms. The lower holds four dishes, such as sucking
forest-boars, venison, hares, tunnies, sturgeons, which you will
find within; the upper three, eight each, but diminutive. The
confectionery is brought separately, for the steam would spoil
it, if any should escape. The melons are in the snow, thirty
feet under us: they came early this morning from a place in
the vicinity of Luni, travelling by night.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> I wonder not at anything of refined elegance in
Lucullus; but really here Antiochia and Alexandria seem to
have cooked for us, and magicians to be our attendants.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> The absence of slaves from our repast is the luxury,
for Marcipor alone enters, and he only when I press a spring
with my foot or wand. When you desire his appearance, touch
that chalcedony just before you.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> I eat quick and rather plentifully; yet the valetudinarian
(excuse my rusticity, for I rejoice at seeing it) appears
to equal the traveller in appetite, and to be contented with one
dish.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> It is milk: such, with strawberries, which ripen on
the Apennines many months in continuance, and some other
berries of sharp and grateful flavour, has been my only diet
since my first residence here. The state of my health requires
it; and the habitude of nearly three months renders this food
not only more commodious to my studies and more conducive
to my sleep, but also more agreeable to my palate than any
other.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> Returning to Rome or Baiae, you must domesticate
and tame them. The cherries you introduced from Pontus
are now growing in Cisalpine and Transalpine Gaul; and the
largest and best in the world, perhaps, are upon the more sterile
side of Lake Larius.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> There are some fruits, and some virtues, which
require a harsh soil and bleak exposure for their perfection.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> In such a profusion of viands, and so savoury, I
perceive no odour.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> A flue conducts heat through the compartments of
the obelisks; and, if you look up, you may observe that those
gilt roses, between the astragals in the cornice, are prominent
from it half a span. Here is an aperture in the wall, between
which and the outer is a perpetual current of air. We are now
in the dog-days; and I have never felt in the whole summer
more heat than at Rome in many days of March.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> Usually you are attended by troops of domestics and
of dinner-friends, not to mention the learned and scientific, nor
your own family, your attachment to which, from youth upward,
is one of the higher graces in your character. Your brother
was seldom absent from you.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> Marcus was coming; but the vehement heats along
the Arno, in which valley he has a property he never saw before,
inflamed his blood, and he now is resting for a few days at
Faesulae, a little town destroyed by Sylla within our memory,
who left it only air and water, the best in Tuscany. The health
of Marcus, like mine, has been declining for several months:
we are running our last race against each other, and never was I,
in youth along the Tiber, so anxious of first reaching the goal.
I would not outlive him: I should reflect too painfully on earlier
days, and look forward too despondently on future. As for
friends, lampreys and turbots beget them, and they spawn
not amid the solitude of the Apennines. To dine in company
with more than two is a Gaulish and German thing. I can
hardly bring myself to believe that I have eaten in concert with
twenty; so barbarous and herdlike a practice does not now
appeal to me&mdash;such an incentive to drink much and talk loosely;
not to add, such a necessity to speak loud, which is clownish
and odious in the extreme. On this mountain summit I hear
no noises, no voices, not even of salutation; we have no flies about
us, and scarcely an insect or reptile.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> Your amiable son is probably with his uncle: is he
well?</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> Perfectly. He was indeed with my brother in his
intended visit to me; but Marcus, unable to accompany him
hither, or superintend his studies in the present state of his
health, sent him directly to his Uncle Cato at Tusculum&mdash;a
man fitter than either of us to direct his education, and preferable
to any, excepting yourself and Marcus Tullius, in eloquence
and urbanity.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> Cato is so great, that whoever is greater must be the
happiest and first of men.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> That any such be still existing, O Julius, ought
to excite no groan from the breast of a Roman citizen. But
perhaps I wrong you; perhaps your mind was forced reluctantly
back again, on your past animosities and contests in the Senate.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> I revere him, but cannot love him.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> Then, Caius Julius, you groaned with reason; and
I would pity rather than reprove you.</p>

<p>On the ceiling at which you are looking, there is no gilding,
and little painting&mdash;a mere trellis of vines bearing grapes, and
the heads, shoulders, and arms rising from the cornice only,
of boys and girls climbing up to steal them, and scrambling for
them: nothing overhead; no giants tumbling down, no Jupiter
thundering, no Mars and Venus caught at mid-day, no river-gods
pouring out their urns upon us; for, as I think nothing so insipid
as a flat ceiling, I think nothing so absurd as a storied one.
Before I was aware, and without my participation, the painter
had adorned that of my bedchamber with a golden shower,
bursting from varied and irradiated clouds. On my expostulation,
his excuse was that he knew the Dana&euml; of Scopas, in a
recumbent posture, was to occupy the centre of the room. The
walls, behind the tapestry and pictures, are quite rough. In
forty-three days the whole fabric was put together and habitable.</p>

<p>The wine has probably lost its freshness: will you try some
other?</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> Its temperature is exact; its flavour exquisite.
Latterly I have never sat long after dinner, and am curious to
pass through the other apartments, if you will trust me.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> I attend you.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> Lucullus, who is here? What figure is that on the
poop of the vessel? Can it be&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> The subject was dictated by myself; you gave it.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> Oh, how beautifully is the water painted! How
vividly the sun strikes against the snows on Taurus! The
grey temples and pierhead of Tarsus catch it differently, and
the monumental mound on the left is half in shade. In the
countenance of those pirates I did not observe such diversity,
nor that any boy pulled his father back: I did not indeed mark
them or notice them at all.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> The painter in this fresco, the last work finished,
had dissatisfied me in one particular. &#8216;That beautiful young
face,&#8217; said I, &#8216;appears not to threaten death.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Lucius,&#8217; he replied, &#8216;if one muscle were moved it were not
Caesar&#8217;s: beside, he said it jokingly, though resolved.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I am contented with your apology, Antipho; but what are
you doing now? for you never lay down or suspend your pencil,
let who will talk and argue. The lines of that smaller face in
the distance are the same.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Not the same,&#8217; replied he, &#8216;nor very different: it smiles,
as surely the goddess must have done at the first heroic act of
her descendant.&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> In her exultation and impatience to press forward
she seems to forget that she is standing at the extremity of the
shell, which rises up behind out of the water; and she takes no
notice of the terror on the countenance of this Cupid who
would detain her, nor of this who is flying off and looking back.
The reflection of the shell has given a warmer hue below the knee;
a long streak of yellow light in the horizon is on the level of her
bosom, some of her hair is almost lost in it; above her head on
every side is the pure azure of the heavens.</p>

<p>Oh! and you would not have shown me this? You, among
whose primary studies is the most perfect satisfaction of your
guests!</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> In the next apartment are seven or eight other
pictures from our history.</p>

<p>There are no more: what do you look for?</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> I find not among the rest any descriptive of your
own exploits. Ah, Lucullus! there is no surer way of making
them remembered.</p>

<p>This, I presume by the harps in the two corners, is the music-room.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> No, indeed; nor can I be said to have one here;
for I love best the music of a single instrument, and listen to it
willingly at all times, but most willingly while I am reading.
At such seasons a voice or even a whisper disturbs me; but
music refreshes my brain when I have read long, and strengthen
it from the beginning. I find also that if I write anything in
poetry (a youthful propensity still remaining), it gives rapidity
and variety and brightness to my ideas. On ceasing, I command
a fresh measure and instrument, or another voice; which is to
the mind like a change of posture, or of air to the body. My
heal this benefited by the gentle play thus opened to the most
delicate of the fibres.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> Let me augur that a disorder so tractable may be
soon removed. What is it thought to be?</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> I am inclined to think, and my physician did not
long attempt to persuade me of the contrary, that the ancient
realms of Aeaetes have supplied me with some other plants than
the cherry, and such as I should be sorry to see domesticated
here in Italy.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> The gods forbid! Anticipate better things! The
reason of Lucullus is stronger than the medicaments of Mithridates;
but why not use them too? Let nothing be neglected.
You may reasonably hope for many years of life: your mother
still enjoys it.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> To stand upon one&#8217;s guard against Death exasperates
her malice and protracts our sufferings.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> Rightly and gravely said: but your country at this
time cannot do well without you.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> The bowl of milk, which to-day is presented to me,
will shortly be presented to my Manes.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> Do you suspect the hand?</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> I will not suspect a Roman: let us converse no
more about it.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> It is the only subject on which I am resolved never
to think, as relates to myself. Life may concern us, death not;
for in death we neither can act nor reason, we neither can
persuade nor command; and our statues are worth more than
we are, let them be but wax.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> From being for ever in action, for ever in contention,
and from excelling in them all other mortals, what
advantage derive we? I would not ask what satisfaction, what
glory? The insects have more activity than ourselves, the
beasts more strength, even inert matter more firmness and
stability; the gods alone more goodness. To the exercise of
this every country lies open; and neither I eastward nor you
westward have found any exhausted by contests for it.</p>

<p>Must we give men blows because they will not look at us?
or chain them to make them hold the balance evener?</p>

<p>Do not expect to be acknowledged for what you are, much
less for what you would be; since no one can well measure a
great man but upon the bier. There was a time when the most
ardent friend to Alexander of Macedon would have embraced
the partisan for his enthusiasm, who should have compared
him with Alexander of Pherae. It must have been at a splendid
feast, and late at it, when Scipio should have been raised to an
equality with Romulus, or Cato with Curius. It has been
whispered in my ear, after a speech of Cicero, &#8216;If he goes on so,
he will tread down the sandal of Marcus Antonius in the long
run, and perhaps leave Hortensius behind.&#8217; Officers of mine,
speaking about you, have exclaimed with admiration: &#8216;He
fights like Cinna.&#8217; Think, Caius Julius (for you have been
instructed to think both as a poet and as a philosopher), that
among the hundred hands of Ambition, to whom we may
attribute them more properly than to Briareus, there is not one
which holds anything firmly. In the precipitancy of her course,
what appears great is small, and what appears small is great.
Our estimate of men is apt to be as inaccurate and inexact as
that of things, or more. Wishing to have all on our side, we
often leave those we should keep by us, run after those we should
avoid, and call importunately on others who sit quiet and will
not come. We cannot at once catch the applause of the vulgar
and expect the approbation of the wise. What are parties?
Do men really great ever enter into them? Are they not ball-courts,
where ragged adventurers strip and strive, and where
dissolute youths abuse one another, and challenge and game
and wager? If you and I cannot quite divest ourselves of
infirmities and passions, let us think, however, that there is
enough in us to be divided into two portions, and let us keep the
upper undisturbed and pure. A part of Olympus itself lies in
dreariness and in clouds, variable and stormy; but it is not the
highest: there the gods govern. Your soul is large enough to
embrace your country: all other affection is for less objects,
and less men are capable of it. Abandon, O Caesar! such
thoughts and wishes as now agitate and propel you: leave them
to mere men of the marsh, to fat hearts and miry intellects.
Fortunate may we call ourselves to have been born in an age
so productive of eloquence, so rich in erudition. Neither of us
would be excluded, or hooted at, on canvassing for these honours.
He who can think dispassionately and deeply as I do, is great
as I am; none other. But his opinions are at freedom to diverge
from mine, as mine are from his; and indeed, on recollection, I
never loved those most who thought with me, but those rather
who deemed my sentiments worth discussion, and who corrected
me with frankness and affability.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> Lucullus, you perhaps have taken the wiser and better
part, certainly the pleasanter. I cannot argue with you: I
would gladly hear one who could, but you again more gladly.
I should think unworthily of you if I thought you capable of
yielding or receding. I do not even ask you to keep our conversation
long a secret, so greatly does it preponderate in your
favour; so much more of gentleness, of eloquence, and of argument.
I came hither with one soldier, avoiding the cities, and
sleeping at the villa of a confidential friend. To-night I sleep
in yours, and, if your dinner does not disturb me, shall sleep
soundly. You go early to rest I know.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> Not, however, by daylight. Be assured, Caius
Julius, that greatly as your discourse afflicts me, no part of it
shall escape my lips. If you approach the city with arms,
with arms I meet you; then your denouncer and enemy, at
present your host and confidant.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> I shall conquer you.</p>

<p><i>Lucullus.</i> That smile would cease upon it: you sigh already.</p>

<p><i>Caesar.</i> Yes, Lucullus, if I am oppressed I shall overcome
my oppressor: I know my army and myself. A sigh escaped
me, and many more will follow; but one transport will rise amid
them, when, vanquisher of my enemies and avenger of my
dignity, I press again the hand of Lucullus, mindful of this day.</p>

<h2><a name="EPICURUS_LEONTION_AND_TERNISSA" id="EPICURUS_LEONTION_AND_TERNISSA"></a>EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA</h2>


<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> The broad and billowy summits of yon monstrous
trees, one would imagine, were made for the storms to rest upon
when they are tired of raving. And what bark! It occurs to
me, Epicurus, that I have rarely seen climbing plants attach
themselves to these trees, as they do to the oak, the maple, the
beech, and others.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> If your remark be true, perhaps the resinous are
not embraced by them so frequently because they dislike the
odour of the resin, or some other property of the juices; for they,
too, have their affections and antipathies no less than countries
and their climes.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> For shame! what would you with me?</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> I would not interrupt you while you were speaking,
nor while Leontion was replying; this is against my rules and
practice. Having now ended, kiss me, Ternissa!</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Impudent man! in the name of Pallas, why should
I kiss you?</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Because you expressed hatred.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Do we kiss when we hate?</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> There is no better end of hating. The sentiment
should not exist one moment; and if the hater gives a kiss on
being ordered to do it, even to a tree or a stone, that tree or
stone becomes the monument of a fault extinct.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> I promise you I never will hate a tree again.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> I told you so.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Nevertheless, I suspect, my Ternissa, you will
often be surprised into it. I was very near saying, &#8216;I hate these
rude square stones!&#8217; Why did you leave them here, Epicurus?</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> It is true, they are the greater part square, and
seem to have been cut out in ancient times for plinths and
columns; they are also rude. Removing the smaller, that I
might plant violets and cyclamens and convolvuluses and strawberries,
and such other herbs as grow willingly in dry places, I
left a few of these for seats, a few for tables and for couches.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Delectable couches!</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Laugh as you may, they will become so when they
are covered with moss and ivy, and those other two sweet plants
whose names I do not remember to have found in any ancient
treatise, but which I fancy I have heard Theophrastus call
&#8216;Leontion&#8217; and &#8216;Ternissa&#8217;.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> The bold, insidious, false creature!</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> What is that volume, may I venture to ask,
Leontion? Why do you blush?</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> I do not blush about it.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> You are offended, then, my dear girl.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> No, nor offended. I will tell you presently what
it contains. Account to me first for your choice of so strange a
place to walk in: a broad ridge, the summit and one side barren,
the other a wood of rose-laurels impossible to penetrate. The
worst of all is, we can see nothing of the city or the Parthenon,
unless from the very top.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> The place commands, in my opinion, a most perfect
view.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Of what, pray?</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Of itself; seeming to indicate that we, Leontion,
who philosophize, should do the same.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Go on, go on! say what you please: I will not hate
anything yet. Why have you torn up by the root all these
little mountain ash-trees? This is the season of their beauty:
come, Ternissa, let us make ourselves necklaces and armlets,
such as may captivate old Sylvanus and Pan; you shall have
your choice. But why have you torn them up?</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> On the contrary, they were brought hither this
morning. Sosimenes is spending large sums of money on an
olive-ground, and has uprooted some hundreds of them, of all
ages and sizes. I shall cover the rougher part of the hill with
them, setting the clematis and vine and honeysuckle against
them, to unite them.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Oh, what a pleasant thing it is to walk in the green
light of the vine trees, and to breathe the sweet odour of their
invisible flowers!</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> The scent of them is so delicate that it requires a
sigh to inhale it; and this, being accompanied and followed by
enjoyment, renders the fragrance so exquisite. Ternissa, it is
this, my sweet friend, that made you remember the green light
of the foliage, and think of the invisible flowers as you would
of some blessing from heaven.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> I see feathers flying at certain distances just above
the middle of the promontory: what can they mean?</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Cannot you imagine them to be the feathers from
the wings of Zethes and Cal&auml;is, who came hither out of Thrace
to behold the favourite haunts of their mother Oreithyia?
From the precipice that hangs over the sea a few paces from the
pinasters she is reported to have been carried off by Boreas;
and these remains of the primeval forest have always been held
sacred on that belief.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> The story is an idle one.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Oh no, Leontion! the story is very true.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> I have heard not only odes, but sacred and most
ancient hymns upon it; and the voice of Boreas is often audible
here, and the screams of Oreithyia.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> The feathers, then, really may belong to Cal&auml;is and
Zethes.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> I don&#8217;t believe it; the winds would have carried
them away.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> The gods, to manifest their power, as they often
do by miracles, could as easily fix a feather eternally on the
most tempestuous promontory, as the mark of their feet upon
the flint.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> They could indeed; but we know the one to a certainty,
and have no such authority for the other. I have seen
these pinasters from the extremity of the Piraeus, and have heard
mention of the altar raised to Boreas: where is it?</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> As it stands in the centre of the platform, we cannot
see it from hence; there is the only piece of level ground in the
place.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Ternissa intends the altar to prove the truth of
the story.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Ternissa is slow to admit that even the young can
deceive, much less the old; the gay, much less the serious.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> It is as wise to moderate our belief as our desires.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Some minds require much belief, some thrive on
little. Rather an exuberance of it is feminine and beautiful.
It acts differently on different hearts; it troubles some, it
consoles others; in the generous it is the nurse of tenderness and
kindness, of heroism and self-devotion; in the ungenerous it
fosters pride, impatience of contradiction and appeal, and, like
some waters, what it finds a dry stick or hollow straw, it leaves
a stone.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> We want it chiefly to make the way of death an
easy one.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> There is no easy path leading out of life, and few
are the easy ones that lie within it. I would adorn and smoothen
the declivity, and make my residence as commodious as its
situation and dimensions may allow; but principally I would
cast under-foot the empty fear of death.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Oh, how can you?</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> By many arguments already laid down: then
by thinking that some perhaps, in almost every age, have been
timid and delicate as Ternissa; and yet have slept soundly,
have felt no parent&#8217;s or friend&#8217;s tear upon their faces, no throb
against their breasts: in short, have been in the calmest of all
possible conditions, while those around were in the most
deplorable and desperate.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> It would pain me to die, if it were only at the idea
that any one I love would grieve too much for me.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Let the loss of our friends be our only grief, and
the apprehension of displeasing them our only fear.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> No apostrophes! no interjections! Your argument
was unsound; your means futile.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Tell me, then, whether the horse of a rider on the
road should not be spurred forward if he started at a shadow.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> I thought so: it would, however, be better to guide
him quietly up to it, and to show him that it was one. Death
is less than a shadow: it represents nothing, even imperfectly.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Then at the best what is it? why care about it,
think about it, or remind us that it must befall us? Would you
take the same trouble, when you see my hair entwined with
ivy, to make me remember that, although the leaves are green
and pliable, the stem is fragile and rough, and that before I go
to bed I shall have many knots and entanglements to extricate?
Let me have them; but let me not hear of them until the time is
come.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> I would never think of death as an embarrassment,
but as a blessing.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> How? a blessing?</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> What, if it makes our enemies cease to hate us?
what, if it makes our friends love us the more?</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Us? According to your doctrine we shall not exist
at all.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> I spoke of that which is consolatory while we are
here, and of that which in plain reason ought to render us
contented to stay no longer. You, Leontion, would make
others better; and better they certainly will be, when their
hostilities languish in an empty field, and their rancour is tired
with treading upon dust. The generous affections stir about us
at the dreary hour of death, as the blossoms of the Median apple
swell and diffuse their fragrance in the cold.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> I cannot bear to think of passing the Styx, lest
Charon should touch me; he is so old and wilful, so cross and ugly.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Ternissa! Ternissa! I would accompany you
thither, and stand between. Would you not too, Leontion?</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> I don&#8217;t know.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Oh, that we could go together!</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> All three, I mean&mdash;I said&mdash;or was going to say it.
How ill-natured you are, Leontion, to misinterpret me; I could
almost cry.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Do not, do not, Ternissa! Should that tear drop
from your eyelash you would look less beautiful.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> If it is well to conquer a world, it is better to
conquer two.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> That is what Alexander of Macedon wept because
he could not accomplish.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Ternissa! we three can accomplish it; or any one
of us.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> How? pray!</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> We can conquer this world and the next; for you
will have another, and nothing should be refused you.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> The next by piety: but this, in what manner?</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> By indifference to all who are indifferent to us;
by taking joyfully the benefit that comes spontaneously; by
wishing no more intensely for what is a hair&#8217;s-breadth beyond
our reach than for a draught of water from the Ganges; and by
fearing nothing in another life.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> This, O Epicurus! is the grand impossibility.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Do you believe the gods to be as benevolent and
good as you are? or do you not?</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Much kinder, much better in every way.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Would you kill or hurt the sparrow that you keep
in your little dressing-room with a string around the leg, because
he hath flown where you did not wish him to fly?</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> No! it would be cruel; the string about the leg of
so little and weak a creature is enough.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> You think so; I think so; God thinks so. This I
may say confidently; for whenever there is a sentiment in which
strict justice and pure benevolence unite, it must be His.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> O Epicurus! when you speak thus&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Well, Ternissa, what then?</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> When Epicurus teaches us such sentiments as
these, I am grieved that he has not so great an authority with
the Athenians as some others have.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> You will grieve more, I suspect, my Ternissa, when
he possesses that authority.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> What will he do?</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Why turn pale? I am not about to answer that
he will forget or leave you. No; but the voice comes deepest
from the sepulchre, and a great name hath its root in the dead
body. If you invited a company to a feast, you might as well
place round the table live sheep and oxen and vases of fish and
cages of quails, as you would invite a company of friendly hearers
to the philosopher who is yet living. One would imagine that
the iris of our intellectual eye were lessened by the glory of
his presence, and that, like eastern kings, he could be looked
at near only when his limbs are stiff, by waxlight, in close
curtains.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> One of whom we know little leaves us a ring or
other token of remembrance, and we express a sense of pleasure
and of gratitude; one of whom we know nothing writes a book,
the contents of which might (if we would let them) have done
us more good and might have given us more pleasure, and we
revile him for it. The book may do what the legacy cannot;
it may be pleasurable and serviceable to others as well as
ourselves: we would hinder this too. In fact, all other love
is extinguished by self-love: beneficence, humanity, justice,
philosophy, sink under it. While we insist that we are looking
for Truth, we commit a falsehood. It never was the first
object with any one, and with few the second.</p>

<p>Feed unto replenishment your quieter fancies, my sweetest
little Ternissa! and let the gods, both youthful and aged, both
gentle and boisterous, administer to them hourly on these
sunny downs: what can they do better?</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> But those feathers, Ternissa, what god&#8217;s may
they be? since you will not pick them up, nor restore them to
Cal&auml;is nor to Zethes.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> I do not think they belong to any god whatever;
and shall never be persuaded of it unless Epicurus says it is so.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> O unbelieving creature! do you reason against the
immortals?</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> It was yourself who doubted, or appeared to doubt,
the flight of Oreithyia. By admitting too much we endanger
our religion. Beside, I think I discern some upright stakes at
equal distances, and am pretty sure the feathers are tied to them
by long strings.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> You have guessed the truth.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Of what use are they there?</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> If you have ever seen the foot of a statue broken
off just below the ankle, you have then, Leontion and Ternissa,
seen the form of the ground about us. The lower extremities
of it are divided into small ridges, as you will perceive if you
look around; and these are covered with corn, olives, and vines.
At the upper part, where cultivation ceases, and where those
sheep and goats are grazing, begins my purchase. The ground
rises gradually unto near the summit, where it grows somewhat
steep, and terminates in a precipice. Across the middle I have
traced a line, denoted by those feathers, from one dingle to
the other; the two terminations of my intended garden. The
distance is nearly a thousand paces, and the path, perfectly on
a level, will be two paces broad, so that I may walk between
you; but another could not join us conveniently. From this
there will be several circuitous and spiral, leading by the easiest
ascent to the summit; and several more, to the road along the
cultivation underneath: here will, however, be but one entrance.
Among the projecting fragments and the massive stones yet
standing of the boundary-wall, which old pomegranates imperfectly
defend, and which my neighbour has guarded more
effectively against invasion, there are hillocks of crumbling
mould, covered in some places with a variety of moss; in others
are elevated tufts, or dim labyrinths of eglantine.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Where will you place the statues? for undoubtedly
you must have some.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> I will have some models for statues. Pygmalion
prayed the gods to give life to the image he adored: I will not
pray them to give marble to mine. Never may I lay my wet
cheek upon the foot under which is inscribed the name of
Leontion or Ternissa!</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Do not make us melancholy; never let us think
that the time can come when we shall lose our friends. Glory,
literature, philosophy have this advantage over friendship:
remove one object from them, and others fill the void; remove
one from friendship, one only, and not the earth nor the universality
of worlds, no, nor the intellect that soars above and
comprehends them, can replace it!</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Dear Leontion! always amiable, always graceful!
How lovely do you now appear to me! what beauteous action
accompanied your words!</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> I used none whatever.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> That white arm was then, as it is now, over the
shoulder of Ternissa; and her breath imparted a fresh bloom
to your cheek, a new music to your voice. No friendship is
so cordial or so delicious as that of girl for girl; no hatred so
intense and immovable as that of woman for woman. In youth
you love one above the others of your sex; in riper age you hate
all, more or less, in proportion to similarity of accomplishments
and pursuits&mdash;which sometimes (I wish it were oftener) are
bonds of union to man. In us you more easily pardon faults
than excellences in each other. <i>Your</i> tempers are such, my
beloved scholars, that even this truth does not ruffle them; and
such is your affection, that I look with confidence to its unabated
ardour at twenty.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Oh, then I am to love Ternissa almost fifteen
months!</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> And I am destined to survive the loss of it three
months above four years!</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Incomparable creatures! may it be eternal! In
loving ye shall follow no example; ye shall step securely over
the iron rule laid down for others by the Destinies, and <i>you</i>
for ever be Leontion, and <i>you</i> Ternissa.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Then indeed we should not want statues.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> But men, who are vainer creatures, would be good
for nothing without them: they must be flattered even by the
stones.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Very true. Neither the higher arts nor the civic
virtues can flourish extensively without the statues of illustrious
men. But gardens are not the places for them. Sparrows,
wooing on the general&#8217;s truncheon (unless he be such a general
as one of ours in the last war), and snails besliming the emblems
of the poet, do not remind us worthily of their characters.
Porticos are their proper situations, and those the most
frequented. Even there they may lose all honour and distinction,
whether from the thoughtlessness of magistrates or
from the malignity of rivals. Our own city, the least exposed
of any to the effects of either, presents us a disheartening
example. When the Thebans in their jealousy condemned
Pindar to the payment of a fine for having praised the Athenians
too highly, our citizens erected a statue of bronze to him.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Jealousy of Athens made the Thebans fine him;
and jealousy of Thebes made the Athenians thus record it.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> And jealousy of Pindar, I suspect, made some poet
persuade the archons to render the distinction a vile and
worthless one, by placing his effigy near a king&#8217;s&mdash;one Evagoras
of Cyprus.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Evagoras, I think I remember to have read in the
inscription, was rewarded in this manner for his reception of
Conon, defeated by the Lacedemonians.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Gratitude was due to him, and some such memorial
to record it. External reverence should be paid unsparingly to
the higher magistrates of every country who perform their
offices exemplarily; yet they are not on this account to be placed
in the same degree with men of primary genius. They never
exalt the human race, and rarely benefit it; and their benefits
are local and transitory, while those of a great writer are universal
and eternal.</p>

<p>If the gods did indeed bestow on us a portion of their fire,
they seem to have lighted it in sport and left it; the harder
task and the nobler is performed by that genius who raises it
clear and glowing from its embers, and makes it applicable to
the purposes that dignify or delight our nature. I have ever
said, &#8216;Reverence the rulers.&#8217; Let, then, his image stand; but
stand apart from Pindar&#8217;s. Pallas and Jove! defend me from
being carried down the stream of time among a shoal of royalets,
and the rootless weeds they are hatched on!</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> So much piety would deserve the exemption, even
though your writings did not hold out the decree.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Child, the compliment is ill turned: if you are
ironical, as you must be on the piety of Epicurus, Atticism
requires that you should continue to be so, at least to the end
of the sentence.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Irony is my abhorrence. Epicurus may appear
less pious than some others, but I am certain he is more; otherwise
the gods would never have given him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> What? what? let us hear!</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Leontion!</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Silly girl! Were there any hibiscus or broom growing
near at hand, I would send him away and whip you.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> There is fern, which is better.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> I was not speaking to you: but now you shall have
something to answer for yourself. Although you admit no
statues in the country, you might at least, methinks, have
discovered a retirement with a fountain in it: here I see not
even a spring.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Fountain I can hardly say there is; but on the
left there is a long crevice or chasm, which we have never yet
visited, and which we cannot discern until we reach it. This
is full of soft mould, very moist, and many high reeds and canes
are growing there; and the rock itself too drips with humidity
along it, and is covered with more tufted moss and more variegated
lichens. This crevice, with its windings and sinuosities,
is about four hundred paces long, and in many parts eleven,
twelve, thirteen feet wide, but generally six or seven. I shall
plant it wholly with lilies of the valley, leaving the irises which
occupy the sides as well as the clefts, and also those other
flowers of paler purple, from the autumnal cups of which we
collect the saffron; and forming a narrow path of such turf as I
can find there, or rather following it as it creeps among the bays
and hazels and sweet-brier, which had fallen at different times
from the summit and are now grown old, with an infinity of
primroses at the roots. There are nowhere twenty steps without
a projection and a turn, nor in any ten together is the chasm
of the same width or figure. Hence the ascent in its windings
is easy and imperceptible quite to the termination, where the
rocks are somewhat high and precipitous; at the entrance they
lose themselves in privet and elder, and you must make your
way between them through the canes. Do not you remember
where I carried you both across the muddy hollow in the
footpath?</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Leontion does.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> That place is always wet; not only in this month
of Puanepsion,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> which we are beginning to-day, but in midsummer.
The water that causes it comes out a little way above
it, but originates from the crevice, which I will cover at top with
rose-laurel and mountain-ash, with clematis and vine; and I
will intercept the little rill in its wandering, draw it from its
concealment, and place it like Bacchus under the protection
of the nymphs, who will smile upon it in its marble cradle,
which at present I keep at home.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Leontion, why do you turn away your face? have
the nymphs smiled upon you in it?</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> I bathed in it once, if you must know, Ternissa!
Why now, Ternissa, why do you turn away yours? have the
nymphs frowned upon you for invading their secrets?</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Epicurus, you are in the right to bring it away
from Athens, from under the eye of Pallas: she might be angry.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> You approve of its removal then, my lovely friend?</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Mightily. [<i>Aside.</i>] I wish it may break in pieces
on the road.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> What did you say?</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> I wish it were now on the road, that I might try
whether it would hold me&mdash;I mean with my clothes on.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> It would hold you, and one a span longer. I
have another in the house; but it is not decorated with fauns
and satyrs and foliage, like this.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> I remember putting my hand upon the frightful
satyr&#8217;s head, to leap in: it seems made for the purpose. But
the sculptor needed not to place the naiad quite so near&mdash;he
must have been a very impudent man; it is impossible to look
for a moment at such a piece of workmanship.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> For shame! Leontion!&mdash;why, what was it? I do
not desire to know.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> I don&#8217;t remember it.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Nor I neither; only the head.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> I shall place the satyr toward the rock, that you
may never see him, Ternissa.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Very right; he cannot turn round.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> The poor naiad had done it, in vain.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> All these labourers will soon finish the plantation,
if you superintend them, and are not appointed to some
magistrature.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Those who govern us are pleased at seeing a
philosopher out of the city, and more still at finding in a season
of scarcity forty poor citizens, who might become seditious,
made happy and quiet by such employment.</p>

<p>Two evils, of almost equal weight, may befall the man of
erudition: never to be listened to, and to be listened to always.
Aware of these, I devote a large portion of my time and labours
to the cultivation of such minds as flourish best in cities, where
my garden at the gate, although smaller than this, we find
sufficiently capacious. There I secure my listeners; here my
thoughts and imaginations have their free natural current, and
tarry or wander as the will invites: may it ever be among those
dearest to me!&mdash;those whose hearts possess the rarest and
divinest faculty, of retaining or forgetting at option what ought
to be forgotten or retained.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> The whole ground then will be covered with trees
and shrubs?</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> There are some protuberances in various parts of
the eminence, which you do not perceive till you are upon them
or above them. They are almost level at the top, and overgrown
with fine grass; for they catch the better soil brought
down in small quantities by the rains. These are to be left
unplanted: so is the platform under the pinasters, whence there
is a prospect of the city, the harbour, the isle of Salamis, and
the territory of Megara. &#8216;What then!&#8217; cried Sosimenes, &#8216;you
would hide from your view my young olives, and the whole
length of the new wall I have been building at my own expense
between us! and, when you might see at once the whole of
Attica, you will hardly see more of it than I could buy.&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> I do not perceive the new wall, for which Sosimenes,
no doubt, thinks himself another Pericles.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Those old junipers quite conceal it.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> They look warm and sheltering; but I like the rose-laurels
much better: and what a thicket of them here is!</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Leaving all the larger, I shall remove many
thousands of them; enough to border the greater part of the
walk, intermixed with roses.</p>

<p>There is an infinity of other plants and flowers, or weeds as
Sosimenes calls them, of which he has cleared his oliveyard,
and which I shall adopt. Twenty of his slaves came in
yesterday, laden with hyacinths and narcissi, anemones and
jonquils. &#8216;The curses of our vineyards,&#8217; cried he, &#8216;and good
neither for man nor beast. I have another estate infested with
lilies of the valley: I should not wonder if you accepted these
too.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And with thanks,&#8217; answered I.</p>

<p>The whole of his remark I could not collect: he turned aside,
and (I believe) prayed. I only heard &#8216;Pallas&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;Father&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;sound
mind&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;inoffensive man&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;good neighbour&#8217;. As we
walked together I perceived him looking grave, and I could not
resist my inclination to smile as I turned my eyes toward him.
He observed it, at first with unconcern, but by degrees some
doubts arose within him, and he said, &#8216;Epicurus, you have been
throwing away no less than half a talent on this sorry piece of
mountain, and I fear you are about to waste as much in labour:
for nothing was ever so terrible as the price we are obliged to
pay the workman, since the conquest of Persia and the increase
of luxury in our city. Under three obols none will do his day&#8217;s
work. But what, in the name of all the deities, could induce
you to plant those roots, which other people dig up and throw
away?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I have been doing,&#8217; said I, &#8216;the same thing my whole life
through, Sosimenes!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How!&#8217; cried he; &#8216;I never knew that.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Those very doctrines,&#8217; added I, &#8216;which others hate and
extirpate, I inculcate and cherish. They bring no riches, and
therefore are thought to bring no advantage; to me, they appear
the more advantageous for that reason. They give us immediately
what we solicit through the means of wealth. We toil
for the wealth first; and then it remains to be proved whether
we can purchase with it what we look for. Now, to carry our
money to the market, and not to find in the market our money&#8217;s
worth, is great vexation; yet much greater has already preceded,
in running up and down for it among so many competitors, and
through so many thieves.&#8217;</p>

<p>After a while he rejoined, &#8216;You really, then, have not overreached
me?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;In what, my friend?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;These roots,&#8217; he answered, &#8216;may perhaps be good and saleable
for some purpose. Shall you send them into Persia? or
whither?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Sosimenes, I shall make love-potions of the flowers.&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> O Epicurus! should it ever be known in Athens
that they are good for this, you will not have, with all your
fences of prunes and pomegranates, and precipices with brier
upon them, a single root left under ground after the month of
Elaphebolion.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> It is not every one that knows the preparation.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Everybody will try it.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> And you, too, Ternissa?</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Will you teach me?</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> This, and anything else I know. We must walk
together when they are in flower.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> And can you teach me, then?</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> I teach by degrees.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> By very slow ones, Epicurus! I have no patience
with you; tell us directly.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> It is very material what kind of recipient you
bring with you. Enchantresses use a brazen one; silver and
gold are employed in other arts.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> I will bring any.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> My mother has a fine golden one. She will lend
it me; she allows me everything.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Leontion and Ternissa, those eyes of yours brighten
at inquiry, as if they carried a light within them for a guidance.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> No flattery!</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> No flattery! Come, teach us!</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Will you hear me through in silence?</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> We promise.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Sweet girls! the calm pleasures, such as I hope
you will ever find in your walks among these gardens, will
improve your beauty, animate your discourse, and correct the
little that may hereafter rise up for correction in your dispositions.
The smiling ideas left in our bosoms from our
infancy, that many plants are the favourites of the gods, and
that others were even the objects of their love&mdash;having once
been invested with the human form, beautiful and lively and
happy as yourselves&mdash;give them an interest beyond the vision;
yes, and a station&mdash;let me say it&mdash;on the vestibule of our affections.
Resign your ingenuous hearts to simple pleasures; and
there is none in man, where men are Attic, that will not follow
and outstrip their movements.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> O Epicurus!</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> What said Ternissa?</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Some of those anemones, I do think, must be still
in blossom. Ternissa&#8217;s golden cup is at home; but she has
brought with her a little vase for the filter&mdash;and has filled it
to the brim. Do not hide your head behind my shoulder,
Ternissa; no, nor in my lap.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Yes, there let it lie&mdash;the lovelier for that tendril
of sunny brown hair upon it. How it falls and rises! Which
is the hair? which the shadow?</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Let the hair rest.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> I must not, perhaps, clasp the shadow!</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> You philosophers are fond of such unsubstantial
things. Oh, you have taken my volume! This is deceit.</p>

<p>You live so little in public, and entertain such a contempt
for opinion, as to be both indifferent and ignorant what it is
that people blame you for.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> I know what it is I should blame myself for, if I
attended to them. Prove them to be wiser and more disinterested
in their wisdom than I am, and I will then go down
to them and listen to them. When I have well considered a
thing, I deliver it&mdash;regardless of what those think who neither
take the time nor possess the faculty of considering anything
well, and who have always lived far remote from the scope of
our speculations.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> In the volume you snatched away from me so slyly,
I have defended a position of yours which many philosophers
turn into ridicule&mdash;namely, that politeness is among the
virtues. I wish you yourself had spoken more at large upon
the subject.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> It is one upon which a lady is likely to display
more ingenuity and discernment. If philosophers have ridiculed
my sentiment, the reason is, it is among those virtues which in
general they find most difficult to assume or counterfeit.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Surely life runs on the smoother for this equability
and polish; and the gratification it affords is more extensive
than is afforded even by the highest virtue. Courage, on nearly
all occasions, inflicts as much of evil as it imparts of good. It
may be exerted in defence of our country, in defence of those
who love us, in defence of the harmless and the helpless; but those
against whom it is thus exerted may possess an equal share of it.
If they succeed, then manifestly the ill it produces is greater
than the benefit; if they succumb, it is nearly as great. For
many of their adversaries are first killed and maimed, and many
of their own kindred are left to lament the consequences of
the aggression.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> You have spoken first of courage, as that virtue
which attracts your sex principally.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Not me; I am always afraid of it. I love those
best who can tell me the most things I never knew before, and
who have patience with me, and look kindly while they teach
me, and almost as if they were waiting for fresh questions. Now
let me hear directly what you were about to say to Leontion.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> I was proceeding to remark that temperance comes
next; and temperance has then its highest merit when it is the
support of civility and politeness. So that I think I am right
and equitable in attributing to politeness a distinguished rank,
not among the ornaments of life, but among the virtues. And
you, Leontion and Ternissa, will have leaned the more propensely
toward this opinion, if you considered, as I am sure you
did, that the peace and concord of families, friends, and cities
are preserved by it; in other terms, the harmony of the world.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Leontion spoke of courage, you of temperance;
the next great virtue, in the division made by the philosophers,
is justice.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Temperance includes it; for temperance is imperfect
if it is only an abstinence from too much food, too much
wine, too much conviviality or other luxury. It indicates
every kind of forbearance. Justice is forbearance from what
belongs to another. Giving to this one rightly what that one
would hold wrongfully in magistrature not in the abstract,
and is only a part of its office. The perfectly temperate man is
also the perfectly just man; but the perfectly just man (as
philosophers now define him) may not be the perfectly temperate
one. I include the less in the greater.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> We hear of judges, and upright ones too, being
immoderate eaters and drinkers.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> The Lacedemonians are temperate in food and
courageous in battle; but men like these, if they existed in
sufficient numbers, would devastate the universe. We alone,
we Athenians, with less military skill perhaps, and certainly
less rigid abstinence from voluptuousness and luxury, have set
before it the only grand example of social government and of
polished life. From us the seed is scattered; from us flow the
streams that irrigate it; and ours are the hands, O Leontion,
that collect it, cleanse it, deposit it, and convey and distribute it
sound and weighty through every race and age. Exhausted
as we are by war, we can do nothing better than lie down and
doze while the weather is fine overhead, and dream (if we can)
that we are affluent and free.</p>

<p>O sweet sea air! how bland art thou and refreshing! Breathe
upon Leontion! breathe upon Ternissa! bring them health and
spirits and serenity, many springs and many summers, and
when the vine-leaves have reddened and rustle under their feet!</p>

<p>These, my beloved girls, are the children of Eternity: they
played around Theseus and the beauteous Amazon; they gave
to Pallas the bloom of Venus, and to Venus the animation of
Pallas. Is it not better to enjoy by the hour their soft, salubrious
influence, than to catch by fits the rancid breath of demagogues;
than to swell and move under it without or against our will;
than to acquire the semblance of eloquence by the bitterness of
passion, the tone of philosophy by disappointment, or the credit
of prudence by distrust? Can fortune, can industry, can
desert itself, bestow on us anything we have not here?</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> And when shall those three meet? The gods have
never united them, knowing that men would put them asunder
at the first appearance.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> I am glad to leave the city as often as possible,
full as it is of high and glorious reminiscences, and am inclined
much rather to indulge in quieter scenes, whither the Graces
and Friendship lead me. I would not contend even with men
able to contend with me. You, Leontion, I see, think differently,
and have composed at last your long-meditated work against
the philosophy of Theophrastus.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Why not? he has been praised above his merits.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> My Leontion! you have inadvertently given me
the reason and origin of all controversial writings. They flow
not from a love of truth or a regard for science, but from
envy and ill-will. Setting aside the evil of malignity&mdash;always
hurtful to ourselves, not always to others&mdash;there is weakness
in the argument you have adduced. When a writer is praised
above his merits in his own times, he is certain of being estimated
below them in the times succeeding. Paradox is dear to most
people: it bears the appearance of originality, but is usually the
talent of the superficial, the perverse, and the obstinate.</p>

<p>Nothing is more gratifying than the attention you are
bestowing on me, which you always apportion to the seriousness
of my observations.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> I dislike Theophrastus for his affected contempt
of your doctrines.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Unreasonably, for the contempt of them; reasonably,
if affected. Good men may differ widely from me, and
wiser ones misunderstand me; for, their wisdom having raised
up to them schools of their own, they have not found leisure
to converse with me; and from others they have received a
partial and inexact report. My opinion is, that certain things
are indifferent and unworthy of pursuit or attention, as lying
beyond our research and almost our conjecture; which things
the generality of philosophers (for the generality are speculative)
deem of the first importance. Questions relating to them I
answer evasively, or altogether decline. Again, there are modes
of living which are suitable to some and unsuitable to others.
What I myself follow and embrace, what I recommend to the
studious, to the irritable, to the weak in health, would ill agree
with the commonality of citizens. Yet my adversaries cry out:
&#8216;Such is the opinion and practice of Epicurus!&#8217; For instance,
I have never taken a wife, and never will take one; but he from
among the mass, who should avow his imitation of my example,
would act as wisely and more religiously in saying that he chose
celibacy because Pallas had done the same.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> If Pallas had many such votaries she would soon
have few citizens to supply them.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> And extremely bad ones, if all followed me in
retiring from the offices of magistracy and of war. Having
seen that the most sensible men are the most unhappy, I could
not but examine the causes of it; and, finding that the same
sensibility to which they are indebted for the activity of their
intellect is also the restless mover of their jealousy and ambition,
I would lead them aside from whatever operates upon these,
and throw under their feet the terrors their imagination has
created. My philosophy is not for the populace nor for the
proud: the ferocious will never attain it; the gentle will embrace
it, but will not call it mine. I do not desire that they should:
let them rest their heads upon that part of the pillow which
they find the softest, and enjoy their own dreams unbroken.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> The old are all against you, Epicurus, the name of
pleasure is an affront to them: they know no other kind of it
than that which has flowered and seeded, and of which the
withered stems have indeed a rueful look.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Unhappily the aged are retentive of long-acquired
maxims, and insensible to new impressions, whether from fancy
or from truth: in fact, their eyes blend the two together. Well
might the poet tell us:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fewer the gifts that gnarled Age presents</span><br />
<span class="i0">To elegantly-handed Infancy,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Than elegantly-handed Infancy</span><br />
<span class="i0">Presents to gnarled Age. From both they drop;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The middle course of life receives them all,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Save the light few that laughing Youth runs off with,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Unvalued as a mistress or a flower.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Since, in obedience to your institutions, O Epicurus,
I must not say I am angry, I am offended at least with Theophrastus
for having so misrepresented your opinions, on the
necessity of keeping the mind composed and tranquil, and
remote from every object and every sentiment by which a
painful sympathy may be excited. In order to display his
elegance of language, he runs wherever he can lay a censure on
you, whether he believes in its equity or not.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> This is the case with all eloquent men, and all
disputants. Truth neither warms nor elevates them, neither
obtains for them profit nor applause.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> I have heard wise remarks very often and very
warmly praised.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Not for the truth in them, but for the grace, or
because they touched the spring of some preconception or some
passion. Man is a hater of truth, a lover of fiction.</p>

<p>Theophrastus is a writer of many acquirements and some
shrewdness, usually judicious, often somewhat witty, always
elegant; his thoughts are never confused, his sentences are
never incomprehensible. If Aristoteles thought more highly
of him than his due, surely you ought not to censure Theophrastus
with severity on the supposition of his rating me below
mine; unless you argue that a slight error in a short sum is less
pardonable than in a longer. Had Aristoteles been living,
and had he given the same opinion of me, your friendship and
perhaps my self-love might have been wounded; for, if on one
occasion he spoke too favourably, he never spoke unfavourably
but with justice. This is among the indications of orderly and
elevated minds; and here stands the barrier that separates them
from the common and the waste. Is a man to be angry because
an infant is fretful? Is a philosopher to unpack and throw
away his philosophy, because an idiot has tried to overturn it
on the road, and has pursued it with gibes and ribaldry?</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Theophrastus would persuade us that, according
to your system, we not only should decline the succour of the
wretched, but avoid the sympathies that poets and historians
would awaken in us. Probably for the sake of introducing
some idle verses, written by a friend of his, he says that, following
the guidance of Epicurus, we should altogether shun the theatre;
and not only when Prometheus and Oedipus and Philoctetes
are introduced, but even when generous and kindly sentiments
are predominant, if they partake of that tenderness which
belongs to pity. I know not what Thracian lord recovers his
daughter from her ravisher; such are among the words they
exchange:</p>

<p><i>Father.</i></p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> I would never close my bosom against the feelings
of humanity; but I would calmly and well consider by what
conduct of life they may enter it with the least importunity
and violence. A consciousness that we have promoted the
happiness of others, to the uttermost of our power, is certain
not only to meet them at the threshold, but to bring them
along with us, and to render them accurate and faithful
prompters, when we bend perplexedly over the problem of evil
figured by the tragedians. If there were more of pain than of
pleasure in the exhibitions of the dramatist, no man in his
senses would attend them twice. All the imitative arts have
delight for the principal object: the first of these is poetry; the
highest of poetry is tragic.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> The epic has been called so.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Improperly; for the epic has much more in it of
what is prosaic. Its magnitude is no argument. An Egyptian
pyramid contains more materials than an Ionic temple, but
requires less contrivance, and exhibits less beauty of design.
My simile is yet a defective one; for a tragedy must be carried
on with an unbroken interest, and, undecorated by loose foliage
or fantastic branches, it must rise, like the palm-tree, with a
lofty unity. On these matters I am unable to argue at large,
or perhaps correctly; on those, however, which I have studied
and treated, my terms are so explicit and clear, that Theophrastus
can never have misunderstood them. Let me recall
to your attention but two axioms.</p>

<p>Abstinence from low pleasures is the only means of meriting
or of obtaining the higher.</p>

<p>Kindness in ourselves is the honey that blunts the sting of
unkindness in another.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Explain to me, then, O Epicurus, why we suffer
so much from ingratitude.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> We fancy we suffer from ingratitude, while in
reality we suffer from self-love. Passion weeps while she says,
&#8216;I did not deserve this from him&#8217;; Reason, while she says it,
smoothens her brow at the clear fountain of the heart. Permit
me also, like Theophrastus, to borrow a few words from a poet.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Borrow as many such as any one will entrust to
you, and may Hermes prosper your commerce! Leontion may
go to the theatre then; for she loves it.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Girls! be the bosom friends of Antigone and Ismene;
and you shall enter the wood of the Eumenides without shuddering,
and leave it without the trace of a tear. Never did you
appear so graceful to me, O Ternissa&mdash;no, not even after this
walk do you&mdash;as when I saw you blow a fly from the forehead
of Philoctetes in the propyl&euml;a. The wing, with which Sophocles
and the statuary represent him, to drive away the summer
insects in his agony, had wearied his flaccid arm, hanging down
beside him.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Do you imagine, then, I thought him a living man?</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> The sentiment was both more delicate and more
august from being indistinct. You would have done it, even
if he <i>had</i> been a living man; even if he could have clasped you
in his arms, imploring the deities to resemble you in gentleness,
you would have done it.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> He looked so abandoned by all, and so heroic, yet
so feeble and so helpless! I did not think of turning around to
see if any one was near me; or else, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> If you could have thought of looking around, you
would no longer have been Ternissa. The gods would have
transformed you for it into some tree.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> And Epicurus had been walking under it this day,
perhaps.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> With Leontion, the partner of his sentiments. But
the walk would have been earlier or later than the present hour;
since the middle of the day, like the middle of certain fruits, is
good for nothing.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> For dinner, surely?</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Dinner is a less gratification to me than to many:
I dine alone.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Why?</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> To avoid the noise, the heat, and the intermixture
both of odours and of occupations. I cannot bear the indecency
of speaking with a mouth in which there is food. I careen my
body (since it is always in want of repair) in as unobstructed
a space as I can, and I lie down and sleep awhile when the work
is over.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Epicurus! although it would be very interesting,
no doubt, to hear more of what you do after dinner&mdash;[<i>Aside to
him.</i>] now don&#8217;t smile: I shall never forgive you if you say a
single word&mdash;yet I would rather hear a little about the theatre,
and whether you think at last that women should frequent it;
for you have often said the contrary.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> I think they should visit it rarely; not because it
excites their affections, but because it deadens them. To me
nothing is so odious as to be at once among the rabble and
among the heroes, and, while I am receiving into my heart the
most exquisite of human sensations, to feel upon my shoulder
the hand of some inattentive and insensible young officer.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Oh, very bad indeed! horrible!</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> You quite fire at the idea.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Not I: I don&#8217;t care about it.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Not about what is very bad indeed? quite horrible?</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> I seldom go thither.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> The theatre is delightful when we erect it in our
own house or arbour, and when there is but one spectator.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> You must lose the illusion in great part, if you
only read the tragedy, which I fancy to be your meaning.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> I lose the less of it. Do not imagine that the
illusion is, or can be, or ought to be, complete. If it were
possible, no Phalaris or Perillus could devise a crueller torture.
Here are two imitations: first, the poet&#8217;s of the sufferer; secondly,
the actor&#8217;s of both: poetry is superinduced. No man in pain
ever uttered the better part of the language used by Sophocles.
We admit it, and willingly, and are at least as much illuded by
it as by anything else we hear or see upon the stage. Poets
and statuaries and painters give us an adorned imitation of the
object, so skilfully treated that we receive it for a correct one.
This is the only illusion they aim at: this is the perfection of
their arts.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Do you derive no pleasure from the representation
of a consummate actor?</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> High pleasure; but liable to be overturned in an
instant: pleasure at the mercy of any one who sits beside me.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Leontion.</i> In my treatise I have only defended your tenets
against Theophrastus.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> I am certain you have done it with spirit and
eloquence, dear Leontion; and there are but two words in it I
would wish you to erase.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Which are they?</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Theophrastus and Epicurus. If you love me, you
will do nothing that may make you uneasy when you grow
older; nothing that may allow my adversary to say, &#8216;Leontion
soon forgot her Epicurus.&#8217; My maxim is, never to defend my
systems or paradoxes; if you undertake it, the Athenians will
insist that I impelled you secretly, or that my philosophy and
my friendship were ineffectual on you.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> They shall never say that.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> I am not unmoved by the kindness of your intentions.
Most people, and philosophers, too, among the rest,
when their own conduct or opinions are questioned, are admirably
prompt and dexterous in the science of defence; but when
another&#8217;s are assailed, they parry with as ill a grace and faltering
a hand as if they never had taken a lesson in it at home. Seldom
will they see what they profess to look for; and, finding it, they
pick up with it a thorn under the nail. They canter over the
solid turf, and complain that there is no corn upon it; they
canter over the corn, and curse the ridges and furrows. All
schools of philosophy, and almost all authors, are rather to be
frequented for exercise than for freight; but this exercise ought
to acquire us health and strength, spirits and good-humour.
There is none of them that does not supply some truth useful
to every man, and some untruth equally so to the few that are
able to wrestle with it. If there were no falsehood in the world,
there would be no doubt; if there were no doubt, there would
be no inquiry; if no inquiry, no wisdom, no knowledge, no genius:
and Fancy herself would lie muffled up in her robe, inactive, pale,
and bloated. I wish we could demonstrate the existence of
utility in some other evils as easily as in this.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> My remarks on the conduct and on the style of
Theophrastus are not confined to him solely. I have taken
at last a general view of our literature, and traced as far as I
am able its deviation and decline. In ancient works we sometimes
see the mark of the chisel; in modern we might almost
suppose that no chisel was employed at all, and that everything
was done by grinding and rubbing. There is an ordinariness,
an indistinctness, a generalization, not even to be found in a
flock of sheep. As most reduce what is sand into dust, the few
that avoid it run to a contrary extreme, and would force us to
believe that what is original must be unpolished and uncouth.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> There have been in all ages, and in all there will
be, sharp and slender heads made purposely and peculiarly for
creeping into the crevices of our nature. While we contemplate
the magnificence of the universe, and mensurate the fitness and
adaptation of one part to another, the small philosopher hangs
upon a hair or creeps within a wrinkle, and cries out shrilly
from his elevation that we are blind and superficial. He discovers
a wart, he pries into a pore; and he calls it knowledge of
man. Poetry and criticism, and all the fine arts, have generated
such living things, which not only will be co-existent with them
but will (I fear) survive them. Hence history takes alternately
the form of reproval and of panegyric; and science in its pulverized
state, in its shapeless and colourless atoms, assumes the
name of metaphysics. We find no longer the rich succulence
of Herodotus, no longer the strong filament of Thucydides, but
thoughts fit only for the slave, and language for the rustic and
the robber. These writings can never reach posterity, nor serve
better authors near us; for who would receive as documents the
perversions of venality and party? Alexander we know was
intemperate, and Philip both intemperate and perfidious: we
require not a volume of dissertation on the thread of history,
to demonstrate that one or other left a tailor&#8217;s bill unpaid, and
the immorality of doing so; nor a supplement to ascertain on
the best authorities which of the two it was. History should
explain to us how nations rose and fell, what nurtured them in
their growth, what sustained them in their maturity; not which
orator ran swiftest through the crowd from the right hand to
the left, which assassin was too strong for manacles, or which
felon too opulent for crucifixion.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> It is better, I own it, that such writers should amuse
our idleness than excite our spleen.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> What is spleen?</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Do not ask her; she cannot tell you. The spleen,
Ternissa, is to the heart what Arimanes is to Oromazes.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> I am little the wiser yet. Does he ever use such
hard words with you?</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> He means the evil Genius and the good Genius,
in the theogony of the Persians: and would perhaps tell you,
as he hath told me, that the heart in itself is free from evil,
but very capable of receiving and too tenacious of holding it.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> In our moral system, the spleen hangs about the
heart and renders it sad and sorrowful, unless we continually
keep it in exercise by kind offices, or in its proper place by
serious investigation and solitary questionings. Otherwise,
it is apt to adhere and to accumulate, until it deadens the
principles of sound action, and obscures the sight.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> It must make us very ugly when we grow old.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> In youth it makes us uglier, as not appertaining to
it: a little more or less ugliness in decrepitude is hardly worth
considering, there being quite enough of it from other quarters:
I would stop it here, however.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Oh, what a thing is age!</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Death without death&#8217;s quiet.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Leontion said that even bad writers may amuse
our idle hours: alas! even good ones do not much amuse mine,
unless they record an action of love or generosity. As for the
graver, why cannot they come among us and teach us, just as
you do?</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Would you wish it?</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> No, no! I do not want them: only I was imagining
how pleasant it is to converse as we are doing, and how sorry
I should be to pore over a book instead of it. Books always
make me sigh, and think about other things. Why do you
laugh, Leontion?</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> She was mistaken in saying bad authors may amuse
our idleness. Leontion knows not then how sweet and sacred
idleness is.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> To render it sweet and sacred, the heart must have
a little garden of its own, with its umbrage and fountains and
perennial flowers&mdash;a careless company! Sleep is called sacred
as well as sweet by Homer; and idleness is but a step from it.
The idleness of the wise and virtuous should be both, it being the
repose and refreshment necessary for past exertions and for
future; it punishes the bad man, it rewards the good; the deities
enjoy it, and Epicurus praises it. I was indeed wrong in my
remark; for we should never seek amusement in the foibles of
another, never in coarse language, never in low thoughts. When
the mind loses its feeling for elegance, it grows corrupt and
grovelling, and seeks in the crowd what ought to be found
at home.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Aspasia believed so, and bequeathed to Leontion,
with every other gift that Nature had bestowed upon her, the
power of delivering her oracles from diviner lips.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> Fie! Epicurus! It is well you hide my face for me
with your hand. Now take it away; we cannot walk in this
manner.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> No word could ever fall from you without its weight;
no breath from you ought to lose itself in the common air.</p>

<p><i>Leontion.</i> For shame! What would you have?</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> He knows not what he would have nor what he
would say. I must sit down again. I declare I scarcely
understand a single syllable. Well, he is very good, to tease you
no longer. Epicurus has an excellent heart; he would give pain
to no one; least of all to you.</p>

<p><i>Leontion,</i> I have pained him by this foolish book, and he would
only assure me that he does not for a moment bear me malice.
Take the volume; take it, Epicurus! tear it in pieces.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> No, Leontion! I shall often look with pleasure on
this trophy of brave humanity; let me kiss the hand that
raises it!</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> I am tired of sitting: I am quite stiff: when shall
we walk homeward?</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Take my arm, Ternissa!</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Oh! I had forgotten that I proposed to myself a
trip as far up as the pinasters, to look at the precipice of
Oreithyia. Come along! come along! how alert does the sea
air make us! I seem to feel growing at my feet and shoulders
the wings of Zethes or Cal&auml;is.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Leontion walks the nimblest to-day.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> To display her activity and strength, she runs
before us. Sweet Leontion, how good she is! but she should
have stayed for us: it would be in vain to try to overtake her.</p>

<p>No, Epicurus! Mind! take care! you are crushing these little
oleanders&mdash;and now the strawberry plants&mdash;the whole heap.
Not I, indeed. What would my mother say, if she knew it?
And Leontion! she will certainly look back.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> The fairest of the Eudaimones never look back:
such are the Hours and Love, Opportunity and Leontion.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> How could you dare to treat me in this manner?
I did not say again I hated anything.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Forgive me!</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Violent creature!</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> If tenderness is violence. Forgive me; and say
you love me.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> All at once? could you endure such boldness?</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Pronounce it! whisper it.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> Go, go. Would it be proper?</p>

<p><i>Epicurus.</i> Is that sweet voice asking its heart or me? let the
worthier give the answer.</p>

<p><i>Ternissa.</i> O Epicurus! you are very, very dear to me;
and are the last in the world that would ever tell you were
called so.</p>

<h2><a name="DANTE_AND_BEATRICE" id="DANTE_AND_BEATRICE"></a>DANTE AND BEATRICE</h2>


<p><i>Dante.</i> When you saw me profoundly pierced with love, and
reddening and trembling, did it become you, did it become you,
you whom I have always called <i>the most gentle Bice</i>, to join in
the heartless laughter of those girls around you? Answer me.
Reply unhesitatingly. Requires it so long a space for dissimulation
and duplicity? Pardon! pardon! pardon! My senses
have left me; my heart being gone, they follow.</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> Childish man! pursuing the impossible.</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> And was it this you laughed at? We cannot touch
the hem of God&#8217;s garment; yet we fall at His feet and weep.</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> But weep not, gentle Dante! fall not before the
weakest of His creatures, willing to comfort, unable to relieve you.
Consider a little. Is laughter at all times the signal or the
precursor of derision? I smiled, let me avow it, from the pride
I felt in your preference of me; and if I laughed, it was to conceal
my sentiments. Did you never cover sweet fruit with worthless
leaves? Come, do not drop again so soon so faint a smile.
I will not have you grave, nor very serious. I pity you; I must
not love you: if I might, I would.</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> Yet how much love is due to me, O Bice, who have
loved you, as you well remember, even from your tenth year.
But it is reported, and your words confirm it, that you are going
to be married.</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> If so, and if I could have laughed at that, and if
my laughter could have estranged you from me, would you
blame me?</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> Tell me the truth.</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> The report is general.</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> The truth! the truth! Tell me, Bice.</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> Marriages, it is said, are made in heaven.</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> Is heaven then under the paternal roof?</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> It has been to me hitherto.</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> And now you seek it elsewhere.</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> I seek it not. The wiser choose for the weaker.
Nay, do not sigh so. What would you have, my grave pensive
Dante? What can I do?</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> Love me.</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> I always did.</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> Love me? O bliss of heaven!</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> No, no, no! Forbear! Men&#8217;s kisses are always
mischievous and hurtful; everybody says it. If you truly
loved me, you would never think of doing so.</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> Nor even this!</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> You forget that you are no longer a boy; and that
it is not thought proper at your time of life to continue the arm
at all about the waist. Beside, I think you would better not
put your head against my bosom; it beats too much to be
pleasant to you. Why do you wish it? why fancy it can do you
any good? It grows no cooler; it seems to grow even hotter.
Oh, how it burns! Go, go; it hurts me too: it struggles, it aches,
it sobs. Thank you, my gentle friend, for removing your brow
away; your hair is very thick and long; and it began to heat me
more than you can imagine. While it was there, I could not
see your face so well, nor talk with you so quietly.</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> Oh, when shall we talk quietly in future?</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> When I am married. I shall often come to visit
my father. He has always been solitary since my mother&#8217;s
death, which happened in my infancy, long before you knew me.</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> How can he endure the solitude of his house when
you have left it?</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> The very question I asked him.</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> You did not then wish to ... to ... go away?</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> Ah no! It is sad to be an outcast at fifteen.</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> An outcast?</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> Forced to leave a home.</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> For another?</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> Childhood can never have a second.</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> But childhood is now over.</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> I wonder who was so malicious as to tell my father
that? He wanted me to be married a whole year ago.</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> And, Bice, you hesitated?</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> No; I only wept. He is a dear good father. I never
disobeyed him but in those wicked tears; and they ran the
faster the more he reprehended them.</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> Say, who is the happy youth?</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> I know not who ought to be happy if you are not.</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> I?</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> Surely you deserve all happiness.</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> Happiness! any happiness is denied me. Ah, hours of
childhood! bright hours! what fragrant blossoms ye unfold!
what bitter fruits to ripen!</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> Now cannot you continue to sit under that old
fig-tree at the corner of the garden? It is always delightful
to me to think of it.</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> Again you smile: I wish I could smile too.</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> You were usually more grave than I, although very
often, two years ago, you told me I was the graver. Perhaps
I <i>was</i> then indeed; and perhaps I ought to be now: but really
I must smile at the recollection, and make you smile with me.</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> Recollection of what in particular?</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> Of your ignorance that a fig-tree is the brittlest of
trees, especially when it is in leaf; and moreover of your tumble,
when your head was just above the wall, and your hand (with
the verses in it) on the very coping-stone. Nobody suspected
that I went every day to the bottom of our garden, to hear you
repeat your poetry on the other side; nobody but yourself;
you soon found me out. But on that occasion I thought you
might have been hurt; and I clambered up our high peach-tree
in the grass plot nearest the place; and thence I saw Messer
Dante, with his white sleeve reddened by the fig-juice, and the
seeds sticking to it pertinaciously, and Messer blushing, and
trying to conceal his calamity, and still holding the verses.
They were all about me.</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> Never shall any verse of mine be uttered from my lips,
or from the lips of others, without the memorial of Bice.</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> Sweet Dante! in the purity of your soul shall Bice
live; as (we are told by the goatherds and foresters) poor
creatures have been found preserved in the serene and lofty
regions of the Alps, many years after the breath of life had left
them. Already you rival Guido Cavalcante and Cino da
Pistoja: you must attempt, nor perhaps shall it be vainly, to
surpass them in celebrity.</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> If ever I am above them ... and I must be ... I
know already what angel&#8217;s hand will have helped me up the
ladder. Beatrice, I vow to heaven, shall stand higher than
Selvaggia, high and glorious and immortal as that name will
be. You have given me joy and sorrow; for the worst of these
(I will not say the least) I will confer on you all the generations
of our Italy, all the ages of our world. But first (alas, from me
you must not have it!) may happiness, long happiness, attend
you!</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> Ah, those words rend your bosom! why should they?</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> I could go away contented, or almost contented, were
I sure of it. Hope is nearly as strong as despair, and greatly
more pertinacious and enduring. You have made me see
clearly that you never can be mine in this world: but at the
same time, O Beatrice, you have made me see quite as clearly
that you may and must be mine in another! I am older than
you: precedency is given to age, and not to worthiness; I will
pray for you when I am nearer to God, and purified from the
stains of earth and mortality. He will permit me to behold
you, lovely as when I left you. Angels in vain should call
me onward.</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> Hush, sweetest Dante! hush!</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> It is there where I shall have caught the first glimpse
of you again, that I wish all my portion of Paradise to be
assigned me; and there, if far below you, yet within the sight of
you, to establish my perdurable abode.</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> Is this piety? Is this wisdom? O Dante! And
may not I be called away first?</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> Alas, alas, how many small feet have swept off the
early dew of life, leaving the path black behind them! But to
think that you should go before me! It almost sends me
forward on my way, to receive and welcome you. If indeed,
O Beatrice, such should be God&#8217;s immutable will, sometimes
look down on me when the song to Him is suspended. Oh!
look often on me with prayer and pity; for there all prayers are
accepted, and all pity is devoid of pain! Why are you silent?</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> It is very sinful not to love all creatures in the world.
But it is true, O Dante! that we always love those the most
who make us the most unhappy?</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> The remark, I fear, is just.</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> Then, unless the Virgin be pleased to change my
inclinations, I shall begin at last to love my betrothed; for
already the very idea of him renders me sad, wearisome, and
comfortless. Yesterday he sent me a bunch of violets. When
I took them up, delighted as I felt at that sweetest of odours,
which you and I once inhaled together....</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> And only once.</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> You know why. Be quiet now, and hear me.
I dropped the posy; for around it, hidden by various kinds of
foliage, was twined the bridal necklace of pearls. O Dante,
how worthless are the finest of them (and there are many fine
ones) in comparison with those little pebbles, some of which
(for perhaps I may not have gathered up all) may be still lying
under the peach-tree, and some (do I blush to say it?) under
the fig! Tell me not who threw these, nor for what. But you
know you were always thoughtful, and sometimes reading,
sometimes writing, and sometimes forgetting me, while I waited
to see the crimson cap, and the two bay-leaves I fastened in it,
rise above the garden-wall. How silently you are listening, if
you do listen!</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> Oh, could my thoughts incessantly and eternally
dwell among these recollections, undisturbed by any other
voice ... undistracted by any other presence! Soon must
they abide with me alone, and be repeated by none but me ...
repeated in the accents of anguish and despair! Why could
you not have held in the sad home of your heart that necklace
and those violets?</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> My Dante! we must all obey ... I my father,
you your God. He will never abandon you.</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> I have ever sung, and will for ever sing, the most
glorious of His works: and yet, O Bice! He abandons me, He
casts me off; and He uses your hand for this infliction.</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> Men travel far and wide, and see many on whom to
fix or transfer their affections; but we maidens have neither the
power nor the will. Casting our eyes on the ground, we walk
along the straight and narrow road prescribed for us; and,
doing this, we avoid in great measure the thorns and entanglements
of life. We know we are performing our duty; and the
fruit of this knowledge is contentment. Season after season,
day after day, you have made me serious, pensive, meditative,
and almost wise. Being so little a girl, I was proud that you,
so much taller, should lean on my shoulder to overlook my work.
And greatly more proud was I when in time you taught me
several Latin words, and then whole sentences, both in prose
and verse, pasting a strip of paper over, or obscuring with
impenetrable ink, those passages in the poets which were
beyond my comprehension, and might perplex me. But
proudest of all was I when you began to reason with me. What
will now be my pride if you are convinced by the first arguments
I ever have opposed to you; or if you only take them up and try
if they are applicable. Certainly do I know (indeed, indeed I
do) that even the patience to consider them will make you
happier. Will it not then make me so? I entertain no other
wish. Is not this true love?</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> Ah, yes! the truest, the purest, the least perishable,
but not the sweetest. Here are the rue and hyssop; but where
the rose?</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> Wicked must be whatever torments you: and will
you let love do it? Love is the gentlest and kindest breath of
God. Are you willing that the tempter should intercept it,
and respire it polluted into your ear? Do not make me hesitate
to pray to the Virgin for you, nor tremble lest she look down on
you with a reproachful pity. To her alone, O Dante, dare I
confide all my thoughts! Lessen not my confidence in my
only refuge.</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> God annihilate a power so criminal! Oh, could my
love flow into your breast with hers! It should flow with
equal purity.</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> You have stored my little mind with many thoughts;
dear because they are yours, and because they are virtuous.
May I not, O my Dante! bring some of them back again to your
bosom; as the <i>contadina</i> lets down the string from the cottage-beam
in winter, and culls a few bunches of the soundest for the
master of the vineyard? You have not given me glory that
the world should shudder at its eclipse. To prove that I am
worthy of the smallest part of it, I must obey God; and, under
God, my father. Surely the voice of Heaven comes to us
audibly from a parent&#8217;s lips. You will be great, and, what is
above, all greatness, good.</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> Rightly and wisely, my sweet Beatrice, have you
spoken in this estimate. Greatness is to goodness what gravel
is to porphyry: the one is a movable accumulation, swept along
the surface of the earth; the other stands fixed and solid and
alone, above the violence of war and of the tempest; above all
that is residuous of a wasted world. Little men build up great
ones; but the snow colossus soon melts: the good stand under
the eye of God; and therefore stand.</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> Now you are calm and reasonable, listen to me, Bice.
You must marry.</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> Marry?</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> Unless you do, how can we meet again unreservedly?
Worse, worse than ever! I cannot bear to see those large heavy
tears following one another, heavy and slow as nuns at the
funeral of a sister. Come, I will kiss off one, if you will promise
me faithfully to shed no more. Be tranquil, be tranquil; only
hear reason. There are many who know you; and all who know
you must love you. Don&#8217;t you hear me? Why turn aside?
and why go farther off? I will have that hand. It twists
about as if it hated its confinement. Perverse and peevish
creature! you have no more reason to be sorry than I have;
and you have many to the contrary which I have not. Being
a man, you are at liberty to admire a variety, and to make a
choice. Is that no comfort to you?</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> I will never be fond of you again if you are so violent.
We have been together too long, and we may be noticed.</p>

<p><i>Dante.</i> Is this our last meeting? If it is ... and that it is,
my heart has told me ... you will not, surely you will not
refuse....</p>

<p><i>Beatrice.</i> Dante! Dante! they make the heart sad after: do
not wish it. But prayers ... oh, how much better are they,
how much quieter and lighter they render it! They carry it
up to heaven with them; and those we love are left behind
no longer.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Filippo! I am informed by my son Cosimo de&#8217;
Medici of many things relating to thy life and actions, and
among the rest, of thy throwing off the habit of a friar.
Speak to me as to a friend. Was that well done?</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Holy Father! it was done most unadvisedly.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Continue to treat me with the same confidence
and ingenuousness; and, beside the remuneration I intend to
bestow on thee for the paintings wherewith thou hast adorned
my palace, I will remove with my own hand the heavy accumulation
of thy sins, and ward off the peril of fresh ones, placing
within thy reach every worldly solace and contentment.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Infinite thanks, Holy Father! from the innermost
heart of your unworthy servant, whose duty and wishes bind
him alike and equally to a strict compliance with your paternal
commands.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Was it a love of the world and its vanities that
induced thee to throw aside the frock?</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> It was indeed, Holy Father! I never had the
courage to mention it in confession among my manifold offences.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Bad! bad! Repentance is of little use to the
sinner, unless he pour it from a full and overflowing heart into
the capacious ear of the confessor. Ye must not go straightforward
and bluntly up to your Maker, startling Him with the
horrors of your guilty conscience. Order, decency, time, place,
opportunity, must be observed.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> I have observed the greater part of them: time,
place, and opportunity.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> That is much. In consideration of it, I hereby
absolve thee.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> I feel quite easy, quite new-born.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> I am desirous of hearing what sort of feelings
thou experiencest, when thou givest loose to thy intractable
and unruly wishes. Now, this love of the world, what can
it mean? A love of music, of dancing, of riding? What in
short is it in thee?</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Holy Father! I was ever of a hot and amorous
constitution.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Well, well! I can guess, within a trifle, what that
leads unto. I very much disapprove of it, whatever it may be.
And then? and then? Prithee go on: I am inflamed with a
miraculous zeal to cleanse thee.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> I have committed many follies, and some sins.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Let me hear the sins; I do not trouble my head
about the follies; the Church has no business with them. The
State is founded on follies, the Church on sins. Come then,
unsack them.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Concupiscence is both a folly and a sin. I felt more
and more of it when I ceased to be a monk, not having (for a
time) so ready means of allaying it.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> No doubt. Thou shouldst have thought again
and again before thou strippedst off the cowl.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Ah! Holy Father! I am sore at heart. I thought
indeed how often it had held two heads together under it, and
that stripping it off was double decapitation. But compensation
and contentment came, and we were warm enough without it.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> I am minded to reprove thee gravely. No wonder
it pleased the Virgin, and the saints about her, to permit that
the enemy of our faith should lead thee captive into Barbary.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> The pleasure was all on their side.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> I have heard a great many stories both of males
and females who were taken by Tunisians and Algerines: and
although there is a sameness in certain parts of them, my
especial benevolence toward thee, worthy Filippo, would induce
me to lend a vacant ear to thy report. And now, good Filippo,
I could sip a small glass of Muscatel or Orvieto, and turn over a
few bleached almonds, or essay a smart dried apricot at intervals,
and listen while thou relatest to me the manners and customs of
that country, and particularly as touching thy own adversities.
First, how wast thou taken?</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> I was visiting at Pesaro my worshipful friend the
canonico Andrea Paccone, who delighted in the guitar, played
it skilfully, and was always fond of hearing it well accompanied
by the voice. My own instrument I had brought with me,
together with many gay Florentine songs, some of which were
of such a turn and tendency, that the canonico thought they
would sound better on water, and rather far from shore, than
within the walls of the canonicate. He proposed then, one
evening when there was little wind stirring, to exercise three
young abbates<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> on their several parts, a little way out of hearing
from the water&#8217;s edge.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> I disapprove of exercising young abbates in that
manner.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Inadvertently, O Holy Father! I have made the
affair seem worse than it really was. In fact, there were only
two genuine abbates; the third was Donna Lisetta, the good
canonico&#8217;s pretty niece, who looks so archly at your Holiness
when you bend your knees before her at bedtime.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> How? Where?</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> She is the angel on the right-hand side of the Holy
Family, with a tip of amethyst-coloured wing over a basket of
figs and pomegranates. I painted her from memory: she was
then only fifteen, and worthy to be the niece of an archbishop.
Alas! she never will be: she plays and sings among the infidels,
and perhaps would eat a landrail on a Friday as unreluctantly
as she would a roach.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Poor soul! So this is the angel with the amethyst-coloured
wing? I thought she looked wanton: we must pray
for her release ... from the bondage of sin. What followed
in your excursion?</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Singing, playing, fresh air, and plashing water,
stimulated our appetites. We had brought no eatable with
us but fruit and thin <i>marzopane</i>, of which the sugar and rose-water
were inadequate to ward off hunger; and the sight of a
fishing-vessel between us and Ancona, raised our host immoderately.
&#8216;Yonder smack,&#8217; said he, &#8216;is sailing at this moment just
over the best sole-bank in the Adriatic. If she continues
her course and we run toward her, we may be supplied, I trust
in God, with the finest fish in Christendom. Methinks I see
already the bellies of those magnificent sole bestar the deck,
and emulate the glories of the orient sky.&#8217; He gave his orders
with such a majestic air, that he looked rather like an admiral
than a priest.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> How now, rogue! Why should not the churchman
look majestically and courageously? I myself have found
occasion for it, and exerted it.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> The world knows the prowess of your Holiness.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Not mine, not mine, Filippo! but His who gave
me the sword and the keys, and the will and the discretion to
use them. I trust the canonico did not misapply his station
and power, by taking the fish at any unreasonably low price;
and that he gave his blessing to the remainder, and to the poor
fishermen and to their nets.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> He was angry at observing that the vessel, while
he thought it was within hail, stood out again to sea.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> He ought to have borne more manfully so slight a
vexation.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> On the contrary, he swore bitterly he would have
the master&#8217;s ear between his thumb and forefinger in another
half-hour, and regretted that he had cut his nails in the morning
lest they should grate on his guitar. &#8216;They may fish well,&#8217;
cried he, &#8216;but they can neither sail nor row; and, when I am in
the middle of that tub of theirs, I will teach them more than
they look for.&#8217; Sure enough he was in the middle of it at the
time he fixed: but it was by aid of a rope about his arms and
the end of another laid lustily on his back and shoulders.
&#8216;Mount, lazy long-chined turnspit, as thou valuest thy life,&#8217;
cried Abdul the corsair, &#8216;and away for Tunis.&#8217; If silence is
consent, he had it. The captain, in the Sicilian dialect, told us
we might talk freely, for he had taken his siesta. &#8216;Whose
guitars are those?&#8217; said he. As the canonico raised his eyes to
heaven and answered nothing, I replied, &#8216;Sir, one is mine: the
other is my worthy friend&#8217;s there.&#8217; Next he asked the canonico
to what market he was taking those young slaves, pointing to
the abbates. The canonico sobbed and could not utter one
word. I related the whole story; at which he laughed. He
then took up the music, and commanded my reverend guest
to sing an air peculiarly tender, invoking the compassion of a
nymph, and calling her cold as ice. Never did so many or such
profound sighs accompany it. When it ended, he sang one
himself in his own language, on a lady whose eyes were exactly
like the scimitars of Damascus, and whose eyebrows met in
the middle like the cudgels of prize-fighters. On the whole she
resembled both sun and moon, with the simple difference that
she never allowed herself to be seen, lest all the nations of the
earth should go to war for her, and not a man to be left to breathe
out his soul before her. This poem had obtained the prize at
the University of Fez, had been translated into the Arabic,
the Persian, and the Turkish languages, and was the favourite
lay of the corsair. He invited me lastly to try my talent. I
played the same air on the guitar, and apologized for omitting
the words, from my utter ignorance of the Moorish. Abdul
was much pleased, and took the trouble to convince me that the
poetry they conveyed, which he translated literally, was incomparably
better than ours. &#8216;Cold as ice!&#8217; he repeated,
scoffing: &#8216;anybody might say that who had seen Atlas: but a
genuine poet would rather say, &ldquo;Cold as a lizard or a lobster.&rdquo;&#8217;
There is no controverting a critic who has twenty stout rowers,
and twenty well-knotted rope-ends. Added to which, he
seemed to know as much of the matter as the generality of those
who talked about it. He was gratified by my attention and
edification, and thus continued: &#8216;I have remarked in the songs
I have heard, that these wild woodland creatures of the west,
these nymphs, are a strange fantastical race. But are your
poets not ashamed to complain of their inconstancy? whose
fault is that? If ever it should be my fortune to take one, I
would try whether I could not bring her down to the level of
her sex; and if her inconstancy caused any complaints, by Allah!
they should be louder and shriller than ever rose from the
throat of Abdul.&#8217; I still thought it better to be a disciple than
a commentator.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> If we could convert this barbarian and detain
him awhile at Rome, he would learn that women and nymphs
(and inconstancy also) are one and the same. These cruel men
have no lenity, no suavity. They who do not as they would
be done by, are done by very much as they do. Women will
glide away from them like water; they can better bear two
masters than half one; and a new metal must be discovered
before any bars are strong enough to confine them. But
proceed with your narrative.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Night had now closed upon us. Abdul placed the
younger of the company apart, and after giving them some
boiled rice, sent them down into his own cabin. The sailors,
observing the consideration and distinction with which their
master had treated me, were civil and obliging. Permission
was granted me, at my request, to sleep on deck.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> What became of your canonico?</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> The crew called him a conger, a priest, and a
porpoise.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Foul-mouthed knaves! could not one of these
terms content them? On thy leaving Barbary was he left
behind?</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Your Holiness consecrated him, the other day,
Bishop of Macerata.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> True, true; I remember the name, Saccone. How
did he contrive to get off?</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> He was worth little at any work; and such men
are the quickest both to get off and to get on. Abdul told me
he had received three thousand crowns for his ransom.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> He was worth more to him than to me. I received
but two first-fruits, and such other things as of right belong to
me by inheritance. The bishopric is passably rich: he may
serve thee.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> While he was a canonico he was a jolly fellow; not
very generous; for jolly fellows are seldom that; but he would
give a friend a dinner, a flask of wine or two in preference, and
a piece of advice as readily as either. I waited on monsignor
at Macerata, soon after his elevation.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> He must have been heartily glad to embrace his
companion in captivity, and the more especially as he himself
was the cause of so grievous a misfortune.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> He sent me word he was so unwell he could not see
me. &#8216;What!&#8217; said I to his valet, &#8216;is monsignor&#8217;s complaint in
his eyes?&#8217; The fellow shrugged up his shoulders and walked
away. Not believing that the message was a refusal to admit
me, I went straight upstairs, and finding the door of an antechamber
half open, and a chaplain milling an egg-posset over
the fire, I accosted him. The air of familiarity and satisfaction
he observed in me left no doubt in his mind that I had been
invited by his patron. &#8216;Will the man never come?&#8217; cried his
lordship. &#8216;Yes, monsignor!&#8217; exclaimed I, running in and
embracing him; &#8216;behold him here!&#8217; He started back, and then
I first discovered the wide difference between an old friend and
an egg-posset.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Son Filippo! thou hast seen but little of the world,
and art but just come from Barbary. Go on.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> &#8216;Fra Filippo!&#8217; said he gravely, &#8216;I am glad to see you.
I did not expect you just at present: I am not very well: I had
ordered a medicine and was impatient to take it. If you will
favour me with the name of your inn, I will send for you when
I am in a condition to receive you; perhaps within a day or two.&#8217;
&#8216;Monsignor!&#8217; said I, &#8216;a change of residence often gives a man a
cold, and oftener a change of fortune. Whether you caught
yours upon deck (where we last saw each other), from being
more exposed than usual, or whether the mitre holds wind, is
no question for me, and no concern of mine.&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> A just reproof, if an archbishop had made it. On
uttering it, I hope thou kneeledst and kissedst his hand.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> I did not indeed.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Oh, there wert thou greatly in the wrong! Having,
it is reported, a good thousand crowns yearly of patrimony,
and a canonicate worth six hundred more, he might have
attempted to relieve thee from slavery, by assisting thy relatives
in thy redemption.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> The three thousand crowns were the uttermost he
could raise, he declared to Abdul, and he asserted that a part
of the money was contributed by the inhabitants of Pesaro.
&#8216;Do they act out of pure mercy?&#8217; said he. &#8216;Ay, they must,
for what else could move them in behalf of such a lazy, unserviceable
street-fed cur?&#8217; In the morning, at sunrise, he was
sent aboard. And now, the vessel being under weigh, &#8216;I have
a letter from my lord Abdul,&#8217; said the master, &#8216;which, being in
thy language, two fellow slaves shall read unto thee publicly.&#8217;
They came forward and began the reading. &#8216;Yesterday I
purchased these two slaves from a cruel, unrelenting master,
under whose lash they have laboured for nearly thirty years.
I hereby give orders that five ounces of my own gold be weighed
out to them.&#8217; Here one of the slaves fell on his face; the other
lifted up his hands, praised God, and blessed his benefactor.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> The pirate? the unconverted pirate?</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Even so. &#8216;Here is another slip of paper for thyself
to read immediately in my presence,&#8217; said the master. The
words it contained were, &#8216;Do thou the same, or there enters thy
lips neither food nor water until thou landest in Italy. I permit
thee to carry away more than double the sum: I am no sutler:
I do not contract for thy sustenance.&#8217; The canonico asked of
the master whether he knew the contents of the letter; he
replied no. &#8216;Tell your master, lord Abdul, that I shall take
them into consideration.&#8217; &#8216;My lord expected a much plainer
answer, and commanded me, in case of any such as thou hast
delivered, to break this seal.&#8217; He pressed it to his forehead
and then broke it. Having perused the characters reverentially,
&#8216;Christian! dost thou consent?&#8217; The canonico fell on his knees,
and overthrew the two poor wretches who, saying their prayers,
had remained in the same posture before him quite unnoticed.
&#8216;Open thy trunk and take out thy money-bag, or I will make
room for it in thy bladder.&#8217; The canonico was prompt in the
execution of the command. The master drew out his scales,
and desired the canonico to weigh with his own hand five
ounces. He groaned and trembled: the balance was unsteady.
&#8216;Throw in another piece: it will not vitiate the agreement,&#8217;
cried the master. It was done. Fear and grief are among the
thirsty passions, but add little to the appetite. It seemed,
however, as if every sigh had left a vacancy in the stomach of
the canonico. At dinner the cook brought him a salted bonito,
half an ell in length; and in five minutes his reverence was
drawing his middle finger along the white backbone, out of sheer
idleness, until were placed before him some as fine dried locusts
as ever provisioned the tents of Africa, together with olives the
size of eggs and colour of bruises, shining in oil and brine. He
found them savoury and pulpy, and, as the last love supersedes
the foregoing, he gave them the preference, even over the delicate
locusts. When he had finished them, he modestly requested
a can of water. A sailor brought a large flask, and poured forth
a plentiful supply. The canonico engulfed the whole, and
instantly threw himself back in convulsive agony. &#8216;How is
this?&#8217; cried the sailor. The master ran up and, smelling the
water, began to buffet him, exclaiming, as he turned round to all
the crew, &#8216;How came this flask here?&#8217; All were innocent.
It appeared, however, that it was a flask of mineral water,
strongly sulphureous, taken out of a Neapolitan vessel, laden
with a great abundance of it for some hospital in the Levant.
It had taken the captor by surprise in the same manner as the
canonico. He himself brought out instantly a capacious stone jar
covered with dew, and invited the sufferer into the cabin. Here he
drew forth two richly-cut wineglasses, and, on filling one of them,
the outside of it turned suddenly pale, with a myriad of indivisible
drops, and the senses were refreshed with the most delicious fragrance.
He held up the glass between himself and his guest, and
looking at it attentively, said, &#8216;Here is no appearance of wine; all
I can see is water. Nothing is wickeder than too much curiosity:
we must take what Allah sends us, and render thanks for it,
although it fall far short of our expectations. Besides, our Prophet
would rather we should even drink wine than poison.&#8217; The
canonico had not tasted wine for two months: a longer abstinence
than ever canonico endured before. He drooped: but the master
looked still more disconsolate. &#8216;I would give whatever I possess
on earth rather than die of thirst,&#8217; cried the canonico. &#8216;Who
would not?&#8217; rejoined the captain, sighing and clasping his
fingers. &#8216;If it were not contrary to my commands, I could
touch at some cove or inlet.&#8217; &#8216;Do, for the love of Christ!&#8217;
exclaimed the canonico. &#8216;Or even sail back,&#8217; continued the
captain. &#8216;O Santa Vergine!&#8217; cried in anguish the canonico.
&#8216;Despondency,&#8217; said the captain, with calm solemnity, &#8216;has left
many a man to be thrown overboard: it even renders the plague,
and many other disorders, more fatal. Thirst too has a powerful
effect in exasperating them. Overcome such weaknesses, or I
must do my duty. The health of the ship&#8217;s company is placed
under my care; and our lord Abdul, if he suspected the pest,
would throw a Jew, or a Christian, or even a bale of silk, into
the sea: such is the disinterestedness and magnanimity of my
lord Abdul.&#8217; &#8216;He believes in fate; does he not?&#8217; said the
canonico. &#8216;Doubtless: but he says it is as much fated that he
should throw into the sea a fellow who is infected, as that the
fellow should have ever been so.&#8217; &#8216;Save me, oh, save me!&#8217;
cried the canonico, moist as if the spray had pelted him. &#8216;Willingly,
if possible,&#8217; answered calmly the master. &#8216;At present I
can discover no certain symptoms; for sweat, unless followed
by general prostration, both of muscular strength and animal
spirits, may be cured without a hook at the heel.&#8217; &#8216;Giesu-Maria!&#8217;
ejaculated the canonico.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> And the monster could withstand that appeal?</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> It seems so. The renegade who related to me, on
my return, these events as they happened, was very circumstantial.
He is a Corsican, and had killed many men in battle,
and more out; but is (he gave me his word for it) on the whole
an honest man.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> How so? honest? and a renegade?</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> He declared to me that, although the Mahomedan
is the best religion to live in, the Christian is the best to die in;
and that, when he has made his fortune, he will make his confession,
and lie snugly in the bosom of the Church.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> See here the triumphs of our holy faith! The lost
sheep will be found again.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Having played the butcher first.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Return we to that bad man, the master or captain,
who evinced no such dispositions.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> He added, &#8216;The other captives, though older men,
have stouter hearts than mine.&#8217; &#8216;Alas! they are longer used
to hardships,&#8217; answered he. &#8216;Dost thou believe, in thy conscience,&#8217;
said the captain, &#8216;that the water we have aboard would
be harmless to them? for we have no other; and wine is costly;
and our quantity might be insufficient for those who can afford
to pay for it.&#8217; &#8216;I will answer for their lives,&#8217; replied the canonico.
&#8216;With thy own?&#8217; interrogated sharply the Tunisian. &#8216;I must
not tempt God,&#8217; said, in tears, the religious man. &#8216;Let us be
plain,&#8217; said the master. &#8216;Thou knowest thy money is safe;
I myself counted it before thee when I brought it from the
scrivener&#8217;s; thou hast sixty broad gold pieces; wilt thou be
answerable, to the whole amount of them, for the lives of thy
two countrymen if they drink this water?&#8217; &#8216;O sir!&#8217; said the
canonico, &#8216;I will give it, if, only for these few days of voyage,
you vouchsafe me one bottle daily of that restorative wine of
Bordeaux. The other two are less liable to the plague: they
do not sorrow and sweat as I do. They are spare men. There
is enough of me to infect a fleet with it; and I cannot bear to
think of being in any wise the cause of evil to my fellow-creatures.&#8217;
&#8216;The wine is my patron&#8217;s,&#8217; cried the Tunisian; &#8216;he leaves everything
at my discretion: should I deceive him?&#8217; &#8216;If he leaves
everything at your discretion,&#8217; observed the logician of Pesaro,
&#8216;there is no deceit in disposing of it.&#8217; The master appeared to
be satisfied with the argument. &#8216;Thou shalt not find me
exacting,&#8217; said he; &#8216;give me the sixty pieces, and the wine shall
be thine.&#8217; At a signal, when the contract was agreed to, the
two slaves entered, bringing a hamper of jars. &#8216;Read the
contract before thou signest,&#8217; cried the master. He read.
&#8216;How is this? how is this? <i>Sixty golden ducats to the brothers
Antonio and Bernabo Panini, for wine received from them?</i>&#8217;
The aged men tottered under the stroke of joy; and Bernabo,
who would have embraced his brother, fainted.</p>

<p>On the morrow there was a calm, and the weather was
extremely sultry. The canonico sat in his shirt on deck, and
was surprised to see, I forget which of the brothers, drink from
a goblet a prodigious draught of water. &#8216;Hold!&#8217; cried he
angrily; &#8216;you may eat instead; but putrid or sulphureous water,
you have heard, may produce the plague, and honest men be
the sufferers by your folly and intemperance.&#8217; They assured
him the water was tasteless, and very excellent, and had been
kept cool in the same kind of earthern jars as the wine. He
tasted it, and lost his patience. It was better, he protested,
than any wine in the world. They begged his acceptance of
the jar containing it. But the master, who had witnessed at a
distance the whole proceeding, now advanced, and, placing his
hand against it, said sternly, &#8216;Let him have his own.&#8217; Usually,
when he had emptied the second bottle, a desire of converting
the Mohammedans came over him: and they showed themselves
much less obstinate and refractory than they are generally
thought. He selected those for edification who swore the
oftenest and the loudest by the Prophet; and he boasted in his
heart of having overcome, by precept and example, the stiffest
tenet of their abominable creed. Certainly they drank wine,
and somewhat freely. The canonico clapped his hands, and
declared that even some of the apostles had been more
pertinacious recusants of the faith.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Did he so? Cappari! I would not have made him
a bishop for twice the money if I had known it earlier. Could
not he have left them alone? Suppose one or other of them
did doubt and persecute, was he the man to blab it out among
the heathen?</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> A judgment, it appears, fell on him for so doing.
A very quiet sailor, who had always declined his invitations,
and had always heard his arguments at a distance and in silence,
being pressed and urged by him, and reproved somewhat
arrogantly and loudly, as less docile than his messmates, at last
lifted up his leg behind him, pulled off his right slipper, and
counted deliberately and distinctly thirty-nine sound strokes
of the same, on the canonico&#8217;s broadest tablet, which (please
your Holiness) might be called, not inaptly, from that day the
tablet of memory. In vain he cried out. Some of the mariners
made their moves at chess and waved their left hands as if
desirous of no interruption; others went backward and forward
about their business, and took no more notice than if their
messmate was occupied in caulking a seam or notching a flint.
The master himself, who saw the operation, heard the complaint
in the evening, and lifted up his shoulders and eyebrows,
as if the whole were quite unknown to him. Then, acting as
judge-advocate, he called the young man before him and repeated
the accusation. To this the defence was purely interrogative.
&#8216;Why would he convert me? I never converted
him.&#8217; Turning to his spiritual guide, he said, &#8216;I quite forgive
thee: nay, I am ready to appear in thy favour, and to declare
that, in general, thou hast been more decorous than people
of thy faith and profession usually are, and hast not scattered
on deck that inflammatory language which I, habited in the dress
of a Greek, heard last Easter. I went into three churches; and
the preachers in all three denounced the curse of Allah on every
soul that differed from them a tittle. They were children of
perdition, children of darkness, children of the devil, one and all.
It seemed a matter of wonder to me, that, in such numerous
families and of such indifferent parentage, so many slippers
were kept under the heel. Mine, in an evil hour, escaped me:
but I quite forgive thee. After this free pardon I will indulge
thee with a short specimen of my preaching. I will call none of
you a generation of vipers, as ye call one another; for vipers
neither bite nor eat during many months of the year: I will call
none of you wolves in sheep&#8217;s clothing; for if ye are, it must be
acknowledged that the clothing is very clumsily put on. You
priests, however, take people&#8217;s souls aboard whether they will
or not, just as we do your bodies: and you make them pay much
more for keeping these in slavery than we make you pay for
setting you free body and soul together. You declare that the
precious souls, to the especial care of which Allah has called and
appointed you, frequently grow corrupt, and stink in His nostrils.
Now, I invoke thy own testimony to the fact that thy soul, gross
as I imagine it to be from the greasy wallet that holds it, had no
carnal thoughts whatsoever, and that thy carcass did not even
receive a fly-blow, while it was under my custody. Thy guardian
angel (I speak it in humility) could not ventilate thee better.
Nevertheless, I should scorn to demand a single maravedi for
my labour and skill, or for the wear and tear of my pantoufle.
My reward will be in Paradise, where a houri is standing in
the shade, above a vase of gold and silver fish, with a kiss on her
lip, and an unbroken pair of green slippers in her hand for me.&#8217;
Saying which, he took off his foot again, the one he had been
using, and showed the sole of it, first to the master, then to all
the crew, and declared it had become (as they might see) so
smooth and oily by the application, that it was dangerous to
walk on deck in it.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> See! what notions these creatures have, both of
their fool&#8217;s paradise and of our holy faith! The seven Sacraments,
I warrant you, go for nothing! Purgatory, purgatory
itself, goes for nothing!</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Holy Father! we must stop thee. <i>That</i> does not
go for nothing, however.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Filippo! God forbid I should suspect thee of any
heretical taint; but this smells very like it. If thou hast it now,
tell me honestly. I mean, hold thy tongue. Florentines are
rather lax. Even Son Cosimo might be stricter: so they say:
perhaps his enemies. The great always have them abundantly,
beside those by whom they are served, and those also whom they
serve. Now would I give a silver rose with my benediction on
it, to know of a certainty what became of those poor creatures
the abbates. The initiatory rite of Mohammedanism is most
diabolically malicious. According to the canons of our Catholic
Church, it disqualifies the neophyte for holy orders, without
going so far as adapting him to the choir of the pontifical chapel.
They limp; they halt.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Beatitude! which of them?</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> The unbelievers: they surely are found wanting.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> The unbelievers too?</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Ay, ay, thou half renegade! Couldst not thou go
over with a purse of silver, and try whether the souls of these
captives be recoverable? Even if they should have submitted
to such unholy rites, I venture to say they have repented.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> The devil is in them if they have not.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> They may become again as good Christians as
before.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Easily, methinks.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Not so easily; but by aid of Holy Church in the
administration of indulgences.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> They never wanted those, whatever they want.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> The corsair then is not one of those ferocious
creatures which appear to connect our species with the lion and
panther.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> By no means, Holy Father! He is an honest man;
so are many of his countrymen, bating the Sacrament.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Bating! poor beguiled Filippo! Being unbaptized,
they are only as the beasts that perish: nay worse: for the soul
being imperishable, it must stick to their bodies at the last day,
whether they will or no, and must sink with it into the fire
and brimstone.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Unbaptized! why, they baptize every morning.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Worse and worse! I thought they only missed
the stirrup; I find they overleap the saddle. Obstinate blind
reprobates! of whom it is written ... of whom it is written
... of whom, I say, it is written ... as shall be manifest
before men and angels in the day of wrath.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> More is the pity! for they are hospitable, frank,
and courteous. It is delightful to see their gardens, when one
has not the weeding and irrigation of them. What fruit! what
foliage! what trellises! what alcoves! what a contest of rose and
jessamine for supremacy in odour! of lute and nightingale for
victory in song! And how the little bright ripples of the docile
brooks, the fresher for their races, leap up against one another,
to look on! and how they chirrup and applaud, as if they too
had a voice of some importance in these parties of pleasure
that are loath to separate.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Parties of pleasure! birds, fruits, shallow-running
waters, lute-players, and wantons! Parties of pleasure! and
composed of these! Tell me now, Filippo, tell me truly, what
complexion in general have the discreeter females of that
hapless country.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> The colour of an orange-flower, on which an overladen
bee has left a slight suffusion of her purest honey.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> We must open their eyes.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Knowing what excellent hides the slippers of this
people are made of, I never once ventured on their less perfect
theology, fearing to find it written that I should be abed on
my face the next fortnight. My master had expressed his
astonishment that a religion so admirable as ours was represented
should be the only one in the world the precepts of which
are disregarded by all conditions of men. &#8216;Our Prophet,&#8217; said
he, &#8216;our Prophet ordered us to go forth and conquer; we
did it: yours ordered you to sit quiet and forbear; and, after
spitting in His face, you threw the order back into it, and fought
like devils.&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> The barbarians talk of our Holy Scriptures as if
they understood them perfectly. The impostor they follow
has nothing but fustian and rodomontade in his impudent
lying book from beginning to end. I know it, Filippo, from those
who have contrasted it, page by page, paragraph by paragraph,
and have given the knave his due.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Abdul is by no means deficient in a good opinion
of his own capacity and his Prophet&#8217;s all-sufficiency, but he
never took me to task about my faith or his own.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> How wert thou mainly occupied?</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> I will give your Holiness a sample both of my employments
and of his character. He was going one evening to a
country-house, about fifteen miles from Tunis; and he ordered
me to accompany him. I found there a spacious garden, overrun
with wild flowers and most luxuriant grass, in irregular
tufts, according to the dryness or the humidity of the spot.
The clematis overtopped the lemon and orange-trees; and the
perennial pea sent forth here a pink blossom, here a purple,
here a white one, and after holding (as it were) a short conversation
with the humbler plants, sprang up about an old cypress,
played among its branches, and mitigated its gloom. White
pigeons, and others in colour like the dawn of day, looked down
on us and ceased to coo, until some of their companions, in whom
they had more confidence, encouraged them loudly from remoter
boughs, or alighted on the shoulders of Abdul, at whose side I
was standing. A few of them examined me in every position
their inquisitive eyes could take; displaying all the advantages
of their versatile necks, and pretending querulous fear in the
midst of petulant approaches.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Is it of pigeons thou art talking, O Filippo?
I hope it may be.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Of Abdul&#8217;s pigeons. He was fond of taming all
creatures; men, horses, pigeons, equally: but he tamed them all
by kindness. In this wilderness is an edifice not unlike our
Italian chapter-houses built by the Lombards, with long narrow
windows, high above the ground. The centre is now a bath,
the waters of which, in another part of the enclosure, had
supplied a fountain, at present in ruins, and covered by tufted
canes, and by every variety of aquatic plants. The structure
has no remains of roof: and, of six windows, one alone is unconcealed
by ivy. This had been walled up long ago, and the
cement in the inside of it was hard and polished. &#8216;Lippi!&#8217;
said Abdul to me, after I had long admired the place in silence,
&#8216;I leave to thy superintendence this bath and garden. Be
sparing of the leaves and branches: make paths only wide
enough for me. Let me see no mark of hatchet or pruning-hook,
and tell the labourers that whoever takes a nest or an egg
shall be impaled.&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Monster! so then he would really have impaled a
poor wretch for eating a bird&#8217;s egg? How disproportionate is
the punishment to the offence!</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> He efficiently checked in his slaves the desire of
transgressing his command. To spare them as much as possible,
I ordered them merely to open a few spaces, and to remove the
weaker trees from the stronger. Meanwhile I drew on the
smooth blank window the figure of Abdul and of a beautiful girl.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Rather say handmaiden: choicer expression; more
decorous.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Holy Father! I have been lately so much out of
practice, I take the first that comes in my way. Handmaiden
I will use in preference for the future.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> On then! and God speed thee!</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> I drew Abdul with a blooming handmaiden. One
of his feet is resting on her lap, and she is drying the ankle with
a saffron robe, of which the greater part is fallen in doing it.
That she is a bondmaid is discernible, not only by her occupation,
but by her humility and patience, by her loose and flowing
brown hair, and by her eyes expressing the timidity at once of
servitude and of fondness. The countenance was taken from
fancy, and was the loveliest I could imagine: of the figure I
had some idea, having seen it to advantage in Tunis. After
seven days Abdul returned. He was delighted with the improvement
made in the garden. I requested him to visit the bath.
&#8216;We can do nothing to that,&#8217; answered he impatiently. &#8216;There
is no sudatory, no dormitory, no dressing-room, no couch.
Sometimes I sit an hour there in the summer, because I never
found a fly in it&mdash;the principal curse of hot countries, and
against which plague there is neither prayer nor amulet, nor
indeed any human defence.&#8217; He went away into the house.
At dinner he sent me from his table some quails and ortolans,
and tomatoes and honey and rice, beside a basket of fruit
covered with moss and bay-leaves, under which I found a
verdino fig, deliciously ripe, and bearing the impression of several
small teeth, but certainly no reptile&#8217;s.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> There might have been poison in them, for all that.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> About two hours had passed, when I heard a whir
and a crash in the windows of the bath (where I had dined and
was about to sleep), occasioned by the settling and again the
flight of some pheasants. Abdul entered. &#8216;Beard of the
Prophet! what hast thou been doing? That is myself! No,
no, Lippi! thou never canst have seen her: the face proves it:
but those limbs! thou hast divined them aright: thou hast had
sweet dreams then! Dreams are large possessions: in them
the possessor may cease to possess his own. To the slave,
O Allah! to the slave is permitted what is not his!... I burn
with anguish to think how much ... yea, at that very hour.
I would not another should, even in a dream.... But, Lippi!
thou never canst have seen above the sandal?&#8217; To which I
answered, &#8216;I never have allowed my eyes to look even on that.
But if any one of my lord Abdul&#8217;s fair slaves resembles, as they
surely must all do, in duty and docility, the figure I have
represented, let it express to him my congratulation on his
happiness.&#8217; &#8216;I believe,&#8217; said he, &#8216;such representations are
forbidden by the Koran; but as I do not remember it, I do not
sin. There it shall stay, unless the angel Gabriel comes to
forbid it.&#8217; He smiled in saying so.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> There is hope of this Abdul. His faith hangs about
him more like oil than pitch.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> He inquired of me whether I often thought of those
I loved in Italy, and whether I could bring them before my eyes
at will. To remove all suspicion from him, I declared I always
could, and that one beautiful object occupied all the cells of
my brain by night and day. He paused and pondered, and then
said, &#8216;Thou dost not love deeply.&#8217; I thought I had given the
true signs. &#8216;No, Lippi! we who love ardently, we, with all our
wishes, all the efforts of our souls, cannot bring before us the
features which, while they were present, we thought it impossible
we ever could forget. Alas! when we most love the absent,
when we most desire to see her, we try in vain to bring her
image back to us. The troubled heart shakes and confounds
it, even as ruffled waters do with shadows. Hateful things are
more hateful when they haunt our sleep: the lovely flee away,
or are changed into less lovely.&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> What figures now have these unbelievers?</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Various in their combinations as the letters or the
numerals; but they all, like these, signify something. Almeida
(did I not inform your Holiness?) has large hazel eyes....</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Has she? thou never toldest me that. Well,
well! and what else has she? Mind! be cautious! use decent
terms.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Somewhat pouting lips.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Ha! ha! What did they pout at?</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> And she is rather plump than otherwise.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> No harm in that.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> And moreover is cool, smooth, and firm as a nectarine
gathered before sunrise.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Ha! ha! do not remind me of nectarines. I am
very fond of them; and this is not the season! Such females
as thou describest are said to be among the likeliest to give
reasonable cause for suspicion. I would not judge harshly,
I would not think uncharitably; but, unhappily, being at so
great a distance from spiritual aid, peradventure a desire, a
suggestion, an inkling ... ay? If she, the lost Almeida, came
before thee when her master was absent ... which I trust
she never did.... But those flowers and shrubs and odours
and alleys and long grass and alcoves, might strangely hold,
perplex, and entangle, two incautious young persons ... ay?</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> I confessed all I had to confess in this matter the
evening I landed.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Ho! I am no candidate for a seat at the rehearsal
of confessions: but perhaps my absolution might be somewhat
more pleasing and unconditional. Well! well! since I am unworthy
of such confidence, go about thy business ... paint!
paint!</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Am I so unfortunate as to have offended your
Beatitude?</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Offend <i>me</i>, man! who offends <i>me</i>? I took an
interest in thy adventures, and was concerned lest thou mightest
have sinned; for by my soul! Filippo! those are the women
that the devil hath set his mark on.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> It would do your Holiness&#8217;s heart good to rub it
out again, wherever he may have had the cunning to make it.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Deep! deep!</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Yet it may be got at; she being a Biscayan by birth,
as she told me, and not only baptized, but going by sea along
the coast for confirmation, when she was captured.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Alas! to what an imposition of hands was this
tender young thing devoted! Poor soul!</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> I sigh for her myself when I think of her.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Beware lest the sigh be mundane, and lest the
thought recur too often. I wish it were presently in my power
to examine her myself on her condition. What thinkest thou?
Speak.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Holy Father! she would laugh in your face.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> So lost!</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> She declared to me she thought she should have died,
from the instant she was captured until she was comforted by
Abdul: but that she was quite sure she should if she were
ransomed.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Has the wretch then shaken her faith?</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> The very last thing he would think of doing. Never
did I see the virtue of resignation in higher perfection than in
the laughing, light-hearted Almeida.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Lamentable! Poor lost creature! lost in this world
and in the next.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> What could she do? how could she help herself?</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> She might have torn his eyes out, and have died
a martyr.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Or have been bastinadoed, whipped, and given up
to the cooks and scullions for it.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Martyrdom is the more glorious the greater the
indignities it endures.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Almeida seems unambitious. There are many in
our Tuscany who would jump at the crown over those sloughs
and briers, rather than perish without them: she never sighs
after the like.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Nevertheless, what must she witness! what
abominations! what superstitions!</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Abdul neither practises nor exacts any other superstition
than ablutions.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Detestable rites! without our authority. I venture
to affirm that, in the whole of Italy and Spain, no convent of
monks or nuns contains a bath; and that the worst inmate of
either would shudder at the idea of observing such a practice
in common with the unbeliever. For the washing of the feet
indeed we have the authority of the earlier Christians; and it
may be done; but solemnly and sparingly. Thy residence
among the Mahomedans, I am afraid, hath rendered thee more
favourable to them than beseems a Catholic, and thy mind, I do
suspect, sometimes goes back into Barbary unreluctantly.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> While I continued in that country, although I was
well treated, I often wished myself away, thinking of my friends
in Florence, of music, of painting, of our villeggiatura at the
vintage-time; whether in the green and narrow glades of
Pratolino, with lofty trees above us, and little rills unseen, and
little bells about the necks of sheep and goats, tinkling together
ambiguously; or amid the grey quarries, or under the majestic
walls of modern Fiesole; or down in the woods of the Doccia,
where the cypresses are of such a girth that, when a youth
stands against one of them, and a maiden stands opposite, and
they clasp it, their hands at the time do little more than meet.
Beautiful scenes, on which heaven smiles eternally, how often
has my heart ached for you! He who hath lived in this country
can enjoy no distant one. He breathes here another air; he
lives more life; a brighter sun invigorates his studies, and
serener stars influence his repose. Barbary hath also the
blessing of climate; and although I do not desire to be there
again, I feel sometimes a kind of regret at leaving it. A bell
warbles the more mellifluously in the air when the sound of the
stroke is over, and when another swims out from underneath it,
and pants upon the element that gave it birth. In like manner
the recollection of a thing is frequently more pleasing than the
actuality; what is harsh is dropped in the space between. There
is in Abdul a nobility of soul on which I often have reflected
with admiration. I have seen many of the highest rank and
distinction, in whom I could find nothing of the great man,
excepting a fondness for low company, and an aptitude to shy
and start at every spark of genius or virtue that sprang up
above or before them. Abdul was solitary, but affable: he was
proud, but patient and complacent. I ventured once to ask
him how the master of so rich a house in the city, of so many
slaves, of so many horses and mules, of such cornfields, of such
pastures, of such gardens, woods, and fountains, should experience
any delight or satisfaction in infesting the open sea, the high-road
of nations. Instead of answering my question, he asked
me in return whether I would not respect any relative of mine
who avenged his country, enriched himself by his bravery, and
endeared to him his friends and relatives by his bounty. On
my reply in the affirmative, he said that his family had been
deprived of possessions in Spain much more valuable than all
the ships and cargoes he could ever hope to capture, and that
the remains of his nation were threatened with ruin and expulsion.
&#8216;I do not fight,&#8217; said he, &#8216;whenever it suits the convenience,
or gratifies the malignity, or the caprice of two silly,
quarrelsome princes, drawing my sword in perfectly good
humour, and sheathing it again at word of command, just when
I begin to get into a passion. No; I fight on my own account;
not as a hired assassin, or still baser journeyman.&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> It appears then really that the Infidels have some
semblances of magnanimity and generosity?</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> I thought so when I turned over the many changes
of fine linen; and I was little short of conviction when I found
at the bottom of my chest two hundred Venetian zecchins.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Corpo di Bacco! Better things, far better things,
I would fain do for thee, not exactly of this description; it would
excite many heart-burnings. Information has been laid before
me, Filippo, that thou art attached to a certain young person,
by name Lucrezia, daughter of Francesco Buti, a citizen of Prato.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> I acknowledge my attachment: it continues.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Furthermore, that thou hast offspring by her.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Alas! &#8217;tis undeniable.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> I will not only legitimatize the said offspring by
<i>motu proprio</i> and rescript to consistory and chancery....</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Holy Father! Holy Father! For the love of the
Virgin, not a word to consistory or chancery of the two hundred
zecchins. As I hope for salvation, I have but forty left, and
thirty-nine would not serve them.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Fear nothing. Not only will I perform what I
have promised, not only will I give the strictest order that no
money be demanded by any officer of my courts, but, under the
seal of Saint Peter, I will declare thee and Lucrezia Buti man
and wife.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> Man and wife!</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Moderate thy transport.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> O Holy Father! may I speak?</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Surely she is not the wife of another?</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> No, indeed.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Nor within the degrees of consanguinity and
affinity?</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> No, no, no. But ... man and wife! Consistory
and chancery are nothing to this fulmination.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> How so?</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> It is man and wife the first fortnight, but wife and
man ever after. The two figures change places: the unit is the
decimal and the decimal is the unit.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> What, then, can I do for thee?</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> I love Lucrezia; let me love her; let her love me.
I can make her at any time what she is not; I could never
make her again what she is.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> The only thing I can do then is to promise I will
forget that I have heard anything about the matter. But, to
forget it, I must hear it first.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> In the beautiful little town of Prato, reposing in its
idleness against the hill that protects it from the north, and
looking over fertile meadows, southward to Poggio Cajano,
westward to Pistoja, there is the convent of Santa Margarita.
I was invited by the sisters to paint an altar-piece for the chapel.
A novice of fifteen, my own sweet Lucrezia, came one day alone
to see me work at my Madonna. Her blessed countenance had
already looked down on every beholder lower by the knees.
I myself who made her could almost have worshipped her.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Not while incomplete; no half-virgin will do.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> But there knelt Lucrezia! there she knelt! first
looking with devotion at the Madonna, then with admiring
wonder and grateful delight at the artist. Could so little a
heart be divided? &#8217;Twere a pity! There was enough for me;
there is never enough for the Madonna. Resolving on a sudden
that the object of my love should be the object of adoration to
thousands, born and unborn, I swept my brush across the
maternal face, and left a blank in heaven. The little girl
screamed; I pressed her to my bosom.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> In the chapel?</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> I knew not where I was; I thought I was in Paradise.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> If it was not in the chapel, the sin is venial. But a
brush against a Madonna&#8217;s mouth is worse than a beard against
her votary&#8217;s.</p>

<p><i>Filippo.</i> I thought so too, Holy Father!</p>

<p><i>Eugenius.</i> Thou sayest thou hast forty zecchins; I will try
in due season to add forty more. The fisherman must not
venture to measure forces with the pirate. Farewell! I pray
God my son Filippo, to have thee alway in His holy keeping.</p>

<h2><a name="TASSO_AND_CORNELIA" id="TASSO_AND_CORNELIA"></a>TASSO AND CORNELIA</h2>


<p><i>Tasso.</i> She is dead, Cornelia! she is dead!</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> Torquato! my Torquato! after so many years of
separation do I bend once more your beloved head to my
embrace?</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> She is dead!</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> Tenderest of brothers! bravest and best and most
unfortunate of men! What, in the name of heaven, so bewilders
you?</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> Sister! sister! sister! I could not save her.</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> Certainly it was a sad event; and they who are out
of spirits may be ready to take it for an evil omen. At this
season of the year the vintagers are joyous and negligent.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> How! What is this?</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> The little girl was crushed, they say, by a wheel of
the car laden with grapes, as she held out a handful of vine-leaves
to one of the oxen. And did you happen to be there
at the moment?</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> So then the little too can suffer! the ignorant, the
indigent, the unaspiring! Poor child! She was kind-hearted,
else never would calamity have befallen her.</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> I wish you had not seen the accident.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> I see it? I? I saw it not. No other is crushed where
I am. The little girl died for her kindness! Natural death!</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> Be calm, be composed, my brother!</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> You would not require me to be composed or calm if
you comprehended a thousandth part of my sufferings.</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> Peace! peace! we know them all.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> Who has dared to name them? Imprisonment,
derision, madness.</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> Hush! sweet Torquato! If ever these existed, they
are past.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> You do think they are sufferings? ay?</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> Too surely.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> No, not too surely: I will not have that answer. They
would have been; but Leonora was then living. Unmanly as
I am! did I complain of them? and while she was left me?</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> My own Torquato! is there no comfort in a sister&#8217;s
love? Is there no happiness but under the passions? Think,
O my brother, how many courts there are in Italy: are the princes
more fortunate than you? Which among them all loves truly,
deeply, and virtuously? Among them all is there any one, for
his genius, for his generosity, for his gentleness, ay, for his mere
humanity, worthy to be beloved?</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> Princes! talk to me of princes! How much cross-grained
wood a little gypsum covers! a little carmine quite
beautifies! Wet your forefinger with your spittle; stick a
broken gold-leaf on the sinciput; clip off a beggar&#8217;s beard to
make it tresses; kiss it; fall down before it; worship it. Are
you not irradiated by the light of its countenance? Princes!
princes! Italian princes! Estes! What matters that costly
carrion? Who thinks about it? [<i>After a pause.</i>] She is dead!
She is dead!</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> We have not heard it here.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> At Sorrento you hear nothing but the light surges of
the sea, and the sweet sprinkles of the guitar.</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> Suppose the worst to be true.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> Always, always.</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> If she ceases, as then perhaps she must, to love and
to lament you, think gratefully, contentedly, devoutly, that her
arms had clasped your neck before they were crossed upon her
bosom, in that long sleep which you have rendered placid, and
from which your harmonious voice shall once more awaken
her. Yes, Torquato! her bosom had throbbed to yours, often
and often, before the organ peal shook the fringes round
the catafalque. Is not this much, from one so high, so
beautiful?</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> Much? yes; for abject me. But I did so love her!
so love her!</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> Ah! let the tears flow: she sends you that balm from
heaven.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> So love her did poor Tasso! Else, O Cornelia, it had
indeed been much. I thought, in the simplicity of my heart,
that God was as great as an emperor, and could bestow and had
bestowed on me as much as the German had conferred or could
confer on his vassal. No part of my insanity was ever held in
such ridicule as this. And yet the idea cleaves to me strangely,
and is liable to stick to my shroud.</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> Woe betide the woman who bids you to forget that
woman who has loved you: she sins against her sex. Leonora
was unblameable. Never think ill of her for what you have
suffered.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> Think ill of her? I? I? I? No; those we love, we
love for everything; even for the pain they have given us. But
she gave me none; it was where she was not that pain was.</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> Surely, if love and sorrow are destined for companionship,
there is no reason why the last comer of the two
should supersede the first.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> Argue with me, and you drive me into darkness. I
am easily persuaded and led on while no reasons are thrown
before me. With these you have made my temples throb again.
Just heaven! dost thou grant us fairer fields, and wider, for the
whirlwind to lay waste? Dost thou build us up habitations
above the street, above the palace, above the citadel, for the
plague to enter and carouse in? Has not my youth paid its
dues, paid its penalties? Cannot our griefs come first, while we
have strength to bear them? The fool! the fool! who thinks
it a misfortune that his love is unrequited. Happier young
man! look at the violets until thou drop asleep on them. Ah!
but thou must awake!</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> O heavens! what must you have suffered! for a
man&#8217;s heart is sensitive in proportion to its greatness.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> And a woman&#8217;s?</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> Alas! I know not; but I think it can be no other.
Comfort thee, comfort thee, dear Torquato!</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> Then do not rest thy face upon my arm; it so reminds
me of her. And thy tears too! they melt me into her grave.</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> Hear you not her voice as it appeals to you, saying
to you, as the priests around have been saying to <i>her</i>, Blessed
soul! rest in peace?</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> I heard it not; and yet I am sure she said it. A
thousand times has she repeated it, laying her head on my heart
to quiet it, simple girl! She told it to rest in peace ... and
she went from me! Insatiable love! ever self-torturer, never
self-destroyer! the world, with all its weight of miseries, cannot
crush thee, cannot keep thee down. Generally men&#8217;s tears,
like the droppings of certain springs, only harden and petrify
what they fall on; but mine sank deep into a tender heart, and
were its very blood. Never will I believe she has left me utterly.
Oftentimes, and long before her departure, I fancied we were in
heaven together. I fancied it in the fields, in the gardens, in
the palace, in the prison. I fancied it in the broad daylight,
when my eyes were open, when blessed spirits drew around me
that golden circle which one only of earth&#8217;s inhabitants could
enter. Oftentimes in my sleep also I fancied it; and sometimes
in the intermediate state, in that serenity which breathes about
the transported soul, enjoying its pure and perfect rest, a span
below the feet of the Immortal.</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> She has not left you; do not disturb her peace by
these repinings.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> She will bear with them. Thou knowest not what
she was, Cornelia; for I wrote to thee about her while she seemed
but human. In my hours of sadness, not only her beautiful
form, but her very voice bent over me. How girlish in the
gracefulness of her lofty form! how pliable in her majesty!
what composure at my petulance and reproaches! what pity in
her reproofs! Like the air that angels breathe in the metropolitan
temple of the Christian world, her soul at every season
preserved one temperature. But it was when she could and
did love me! Unchanged must ever be the blessed one who has
leaned in fond security on the unchangeable. The purifying
flame shoots upward, and is the glory that encircles their brows
when they meet above.</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> Indulge in these delightful thoughts, my Torquato!
and believe that your love is and ought to be imperishable as
your glory. Generations of men move forward in endless procession
to consecrate and commemorate both. Colour-grinders
and gilders, year after year, are bargained with to refresh the
crumbling monuments and tarnished decorations of rude,
unregarded royalty, and to fasten the nails that cramp the crown
upon its head. Meanwhile, in the laurels of my Torquato
there will always be one leaf above man&#8217;s reach, above time&#8217;s
wrath and injury, inscribed with the name of Leonora.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> O Jerusalem! I have not then sung in vain the Holy
Sepulchre.</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> After such devotion of your genius, you have
undergone too many misfortunes.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> Congratulate the man who has had many, and may
have more. I have had, I have, I can have, one only.</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> Life runs not smoothly at all seasons, even with
the happiest; but after a long course, the rocks subside, the
views widen, and it flows on more equably at the end.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> Have the stars smooth surfaces? No, no; but how
they shine!</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> Capable of thoughts so exalted, so far above the
earth we dwell on, why suffer any to depress and anguish you?</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> Cornelia, Cornelia! the mind has within its temples
and porticoes and palaces and towers: the mind has under it,
ready for the course, steeds brighter than the sun and stronger
than the storm; and beside them stand winged chariots, more in
number than the Psalmist hath attributed to the Almighty.
The mind, I tell thee again, hath its hundred gates, compared
whereto the Theban are but willow wickets; and all those hundred
gates can genius throw open. But there are some that groan
heavily on their hinges, and the hand of God alone can close them.</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> Torquato has thrown open those of His holy temple;
Torquato hath stood, another angel, at His tomb; and am I
the sister of Torquato? Kiss me, my brother, and let my tears
run only from my pride and joy! Princes have bestowed
knighthood on the worthy and unworthy; thou hast called forth
those princes from their ranks, pushing back the arrogant and
presumptuous of them like intrusive varlets, and conferring on
the bettermost crowns and robes, imperishable and unfading.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> I seem to live back into those days. I feel the helmet
on my head; I wave the standard over it: brave men smile
upon me; beautiful maidens pull them gently back by the scarf,
and will not let them break my slumber, nor undraw the curtain.
Corneliolina!...</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> Well, my dear brother! why do you stop so suddenly
in the midst of them? They are the pleasantest and best
company, and they make you look quite happy and joyous.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> Corneliolina, dost thou remember Bergamo? What
city was ever so celebrated for honest and valiant men, in all
classes, or for beautiful girls! There is but one class of those:
Beauty is above all ranks; the true Madonna, the patroness
and bestower of felicity, the queen of heaven.</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> Hush, Torquato, hush! talk not so.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> What rivers, how sunshiny and revelling, are the
Brembo and the Serio! What a country the Valtellina! I went
back to our father&#8217;s house, thinking to find thee again, my little
sister; thinking to kick away thy ball of yellow silk as thou wast
stooping for it, to make thee run after me and beat me. I
woke early in the morning; thou wert grown up and gone.
Away to Sorrento: I knew the road: a few strides brought me
back: here I am. To-morrow, my Cornelia, we will walk
together, as we used to do, into the cool and quiet caves on the
shore; and we will catch the little breezes as they come in and
go out again on the backs of the jocund waves.</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> We will indeed to-morrow; but before we set out
we must take a few hours&#8217; rest, that we may enjoy our ramble
the better.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> Our Sorrentines, I see, are grown rich and avaricious.
They have uprooted the old pomegranate hedges, and have
built high walls to prohibit the wayfarer from their vineyards.</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> I have a basket of grapes for you in the book-room
that overlooks our garden.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> Does the old twisted sage-tree grow still against the
window?</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> It harboured too many insects at last, and there was
always a nest of scorpions in the crevice.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> Oh! what a prince of a sage-tree! And the well, too,
with its bucket of shining metal, large enough for the largest
cocomero to cool in it for dinner.</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> The well, I assure you, is as cool as ever.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> Delicious! delicious! And the stone-work round it,
bearing no other marks of waste than my pruning-hook and
dagger left behind?</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> None whatever.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> White in that place no longer; there has been time
enough for it to become all of one colour: grey, mossy, half-decayed.</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> No, no; not even the rope has wanted repair.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> Who sings yonder?</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> Enchanter! No sooner did you say the word
cocomero than here comes a boy carrying one upon his head.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> Listen! listen! I have read in some book or other those
verses long ago. They are not unlike my <i>Aminta</i>. The very words!</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> Purifier of love, and humanizer of ferocity, how
many, my Torquato, will your gentle thoughts make happy!</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> At this moment I almost think I am one among them.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> Be quite persuaded of it. Come, brother, come
with me. You shall bathe your heated brow and weary limbs
in the chamber of your childhood. It is there we are always
the most certain of repose. The boy shall sing to you those
sweet verses; and we will reward him with a slice of his own fruit.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> He deserves it; cut it thick.</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> Come then, my truant! Come along, my sweet
smiling Torquato!</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> The passage is darker than ever. Is this the way to
the little court? Surely those are not the steps that lead down
toward the bath? Oh yes! we are right; I smell the lemon-blossoms.
Beware of the old wilding that bears them;
it may catch your veil; it may scratch your fingers! Pray,
take care: it has many thorns about it. And now, Leonora!
you shall hear my last verses! Lean your ear a little toward
me; for I must repeat them softly under this low archway,
else others may hear them too. Ah! you press my hand once
more. Drop it, drop it! or the verses will sink into my breast
again, and lie there silent! Good girl!</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Many, well I know, there are</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ready in your joys to share,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And (I never blame it) you</span><br />

</div>
</div>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> We are now in the full light of the chamber; cannot
you remember it, having looked so intently all around?</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> O sister! I could have slept another hour. You
thought I wanted rest: why did you waken me so early? I
could have slept another hour or longer. What a dream!
But I am calm and happy.</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> May you never more be otherwise! Indeed, he
cannot be whose last verses are such as those.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> Have you written any since that morning?</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> What morning?</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> When you caught the swallow in my curtains, and
trod upon my knees in catching it, luckily with naked feet.
The little girl of thirteen laughed at the outcry of her brother
Torquatino, and sang without a blush her earliest lay.</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> I do not recollect it.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> I do.</p>

<p><i>Cornelia.</i> Here is the cocomero; it cannot be more insipid.
Try it.</p>

<p><i>Tasso.</i> Where is the boy who brought it? where is the boy
who sang my <i>Aminta</i>? Serve him first; give him largely. Cut
deeper; the knife is too short: deeper; mia brava Corneliolina!
quite through all the red, and into the middle of the seeds.
Well done!</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> The miseries of Tasso arose not only from the imagination and the
heart. In the metropolis of the Christian world, with many admirers
and many patrons, bishops, cardinals, princes, he was left destitute, and
almost famished. These are his own words: &#8216;<i>Appena</i> in questo stato ho
comprato <i>due meloni</i>: e bench&egrave; io sia stato <i>quasi sempre infermo</i>, molte
volte mi sono contentato del manzo: e la ministra di latte o di zucca,
<i>quando ho potuto averne</i>, mi &egrave; stata in vece di delizie.&#8217; In another part he
says that he was unable to pay the carriage of a parcel. No wonder;
if he had not wherewithal to buy enough of zucca for a meal. Even
had he been in health and appetite, he might have satisfied his hunger
with it for about five farthings, and have left half for supper. And now
a word on his insanity. Having been so imprudent not only as to make it
too evident in his poetry that he was the lover of Leonora, but also to
signify (not very obscurely) that his love was returned, he much perplexed
the Duke of Ferrara, who, with great discretion, suggested to him the
necessity of feigning madness. The lady&#8217;s honour required it from a
brother; and a true lover, to convince the world, would embrace the project
with alacrity. But there was no reason why the seclusion should be in a
dungeon, or why exercise and air should be interdicted. This cruelty,
and perhaps his uncertainty of Leonora&#8217;s compassion, may well be imagined
to have produced at last the malady he had feigned. But did Leonora love
Tasso as a man would be loved? If we wish to do her honour, let us hope
it: for what greater glory can there be, than to have estimated at the
full value so exalted a genius, so affectionate and so generous a heart!</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> The author wrote the verses first in English, but he found it easy to
write them better in Italian: they stood in the text as below: they only
do for a girl of thirteen:</p>

<span class="i0">You were blacker than a crow?</span><br />

<h2><a name="LA_FONTAINE_AND_DE_LA_ROCHEFOUCAULT" id="LA_FONTAINE_AND_DE_LA_ROCHEFOUCAULT"></a>LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT</h2>


<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> I am truly sensible of the honour I receive,
M. de la Rochefoucault, in a visit from a personage so distinguished
by his birth and by his genius. Pardon my ambition,
if I confess to you that I have long and ardently wished for the
good fortune, which I never could promise myself, of knowing
you personally.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> My dear M. de la Fontaine!</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Not &#8216;<i>de</i> la&#8217;, not &#8216;<i>de</i> la&#8217;. I am <i>La</i> Fontaine,
purely and simply.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> The whole; not derivative. You appear, in
the midst of your purity, to have been educated at court, in
the lap of the ladies. What was the last day (pardon!) I had
the misfortune to miss you there?</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> I never go to court. They say one cannot go
without silk stockings; and I have only thread: plenty of them
indeed, thank God! Yet, would you believe it? Nanon, in
putting a <i>solette</i> to the bottom of one, last week, sewed it so
carelessly, she made a kind of cord across: and I verily believe
it will lame me for life; for I walked the whole morning upon it.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> She ought to be whipped.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> I thought so too, and grew the warmer at being
unable to find a wisp of osier or a roll of packthread in the house.
Barely had I begun with my garter, when in came the Bishop
of Grasse, my old friend Godeau, and another lord, whose name
he mentioned, and they both interceded for her so long and so
touchingly, that at last I was fain to let her rise up and go.
I never saw men look down on the erring and afflicted more
compassionately. The bishop was quite concerned for me also.
But the other, although he professed to feel even more, and said
that it must surely be the pain of purgatory to me, took a pinch
of snuff, opened his waistcoat, drew down his ruffles, and seemed
rather more indifferent.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Providentially, in such moving scenes, the
worst is soon over. But Godeau&#8217;s friend was not too sensitive.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Sensitive! no more than if he had been educated
at the butcher&#8217;s or the Sorbonne.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> I am afraid there are as many hard hearts
under satin waistcoats as there are ugly visages under the same
material in miniature cases.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> My lord, I could show you a miniature case which
contains your humble servant, in which the painter has done
what no tailor in his senses would do; he has given me credit
for a coat of violet silk, with silver frogs as large as tortoises.
But I am loath to get up for it while the generous heart of this
dog (if I mentioned his name he would jump up) places such
confidence on my knee.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Pray do not move on any account; above all,
lest you should disturb that amiable grey cat, fast asleep in his
innocence on your shoulder.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Ah, rogue! art thou there? Why! thou hast
not licked my face this half-hour.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> And more, too, I should imagine. I do not
judge from his somnolency, which, if he were President of the
Parliament, could not be graver, but from his natural sagacity.
Cats weigh practicabilities. What sort of tongue has he?</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> He has the roughest tongue and the tenderest
heart of any cat in Paris. If you observe the colour of his coat,
it is rather blue than grey; a certain indication of goodness in
these contemplative creatures.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> We were talking of his tongue alone; by which
cats, like men, are flatterers.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Ah! you gentlemen of the court are much
mistaken in thinking that vices have so extensive a range.
There are some of our vices, like some of our diseases, from which
the quadrupeds are exempt; and those, both diseases and vices,
are the most discreditable.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> I do not bear patiently any evil spoken of the
court: for it must be acknowledged, by the most malicious, that
the court is the purifier of the whole nation.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> I know little of the court, and less of the whole
nation; but how can this be?</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> It collects all ramblers and gamblers; all the
market-men and market-women who deal in articles which God
has thrown into their baskets, without any trouble on their part;
all the seducers and all who wish to be seduced; all the duellists
who erase their crimes with their swords, and sweat out their
cowardice with daily practice; all the nobles whose patents of
nobility lie in gold snuff-boxes, or have worn Mechlin ruffles,
or are deposited within the archives of knee-deep waistcoats; all
stock-jobbers and church-jobbers, the black-legged and the red-legged
game, the flower of the <i>justaucorps</i>, the <i>robe</i>, and the
<i>soutane</i>. If these were spread over the surface of France,
instead of close compressure in the court or cabinet, they would
corrupt the whole country in two years. As matters now stand,
it will require a quarter of a century to effect it.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Am I not right then in preferring my beasts
to yours? But if yours were loose, mine (as you prove to me)
would be the last to suffer by it, poor dear creatures! Speaking
of cats, I would have avoided all personality that might be
offensive to them: I would not exactly have said, in so many
words, that, by their tongues, they are flatterers, like men.
Language may take a turn advantageously in favour of our
friends. True, we resemble all animals in something. I am quite
ashamed and mortified that your lordship, or anybody, should
have had the start of me in this reflection. When a cat flatters
with his tongue he is not insincere: you may safely take it for
a real kindness. He is loyal, M. de la Rochefoucault! my word
for him, he is loyal. Observe too, if you please, no cat ever
licks you when he wants anything from you; so that there is
nothing of baseness in such an act of adulation, if we must call
it so. For my part, I am slow to designate by so foul a name,
that (be it what it may) which is subsequent to a kindness.
Cats ask plainly for what they want.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> And, if they cannot get it by protocols they
get it by invasion and assault.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> No! no! usually they go elsewhere, and fondle
those from whom they obtain it. In this I see no resemblance
to invaders and conquerors. I draw no parallels: I would excite
no heart-burnings between us and them. Let all have their due.</p>

<p>I do not like to lift this creature off, for it would waken him,
else I could find out, by some subsequent action, the reason
why he has not been on the alert to lick my cheek for so long
a time.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Cats are wary and provident. He would not
enter into any contest with you, however friendly. He only
licks your face, I presume, while your beard is but a match
for his tongue.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Ha! you remind me. Indeed I did begin to
think my beard was rather of the roughest; for yesterday
Madame de Rambouillet sent me a plate of strawberries, the
first of the season, and raised (would you believe it?) under
glass. One of these strawberries was dropping from my lips,
and I attempted to stop it. When I thought it had fallen
to the ground, &#8216;Look for it, Nanon; pick it up and eat it,&#8217;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Master!&#8217; cried the wench, &#8216;your beard has skewered and
spitted it.&#8217; &#8216;Honest girl,&#8217; I answered, &#8216;come, cull it from the
bed of its adoption.&#8217;</p>

<p>I had resolved to shave myself this morning: but our wisest
and best resolutions too often come to nothing, poor mortals!</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> We often do very well everything but the only
thing we hope to do best of all; and our projects often drop from
us by their weight. A little while ago your friend Moli&egrave;re
exhibited a remarkable proof of it.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Ah, poor Moli&egrave;re! the best man in the world;
but flighty, negligent, thoughtless. He throws himself into
other men, and does not remember where. The sight of an eagle,
M. de la Rochefoucault, but the memory of a fly.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault</i>. I will give you an example: but perhaps it is
already known to you.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Likely enough. We have each so many friends,
neither of us can trip but the other is invited to the laugh.
Well; I am sure he has no malice, and I hope I have none: but
who can see his own faults?</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> He had brought out a new edition of his
comedies.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> There will be fifty; there will be a hundred:
nothing in our language, or in any, is so delightful, so graceful;
I will add, so clear at once and so profound.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> You are among the few who, seeing well his
other qualities, see that Moli&egrave;re is also profound. In order
to present the new edition to the dauphin, he had put on a
sky-blue velvet coat, powdered with fleurs-de-lis. He laid the
volume on his library table; and, resolving that none of the
courtiers should have an opportunity of ridiculing him for
anything like absence of mind, he returned to his bedroom,
which, as may often be the case in the economy of poets, is also
his dressing-room. Here he surveyed himself in his mirror,
as well as the creeks and lagoons in it would permit.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> I do assure you, from my own observation,
M. de la Rochefoucault, that his mirror is a splendid one. I
should take it to be nearly three feet high, reckoning the frame,
with the Cupid above and the elephant under. I suspected it
was the present of some great lady; and indeed I have since
heard as much.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Perhaps then the whole story may be quite
as fabulous as the part of it which I have been relating.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> In that case, I may be able to set you right again.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> He found his peruke a model of perfection;
tight, yet easy; not an inch more on one side than on the other.
The black patch on the forehead....</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Black patch too! I would have given a fifteen-sous
piece to have caught him with that black patch.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> He found it lovely, marvellous, irresistible.
Those on each cheek....</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Do you tell me he had one on each cheek?</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Symmetrically. The cravat was of its proper
descent, and with its appropriate charge of the best Strasburg
snuff upon it. The waistcoat, for a moment, puzzled and perplexed
him. He was not quite sure whether the right number
of buttons were in their holes; nor how many above, nor how
many below, it was the fashion of the week to leave without
occupation. Such a piece of ignorance is enough to disgrace
any courtier on earth. He was in the act of striking his forehead
with desperation; but he thought of the patch, fell on his
knees, and thanked Heaven for the intervention.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Just like him! just like him! good soul!</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> The breeches ... ah! those require attention:
all proper: everything in its place. Magnificent. The stockings
rolled up, neither too loosely nor too negligently. A picture!
The buckles in the shoes ... all but one ... soon set to
rights ... well thought of! And now the sword ... ah,
that cursed sword! it will bring at least one man to the ground
if it has its own way much longer ... up with it! up with it
higher.... <i>Allons!</i> we are out of danger.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Delightful! I have him before my eyes. What
simplicity! aye, what simplicity!</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Now for hat. Feather in? Five at least.
Bravo!</p>

<p>He took up hat and plumage, extended his arm to the full
length, raised it a foot above his head, lowered it thereon, opened
his fingers, and let them fall again at his side.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Something of the comedian in that; aye, M. de
la Rochefoucault? But, on the stage or off, all is natural in
Moli&egrave;re.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Away he went: he reached the palace, stood
before the dauphin.... O consternation! O despair! &#8216;Morbleu!
b&ecirc;te que je suis,&#8217; exclaimed the hapless man, &#8216;le livre, o&ugrave;
donc est-il?&#8217; You are forcibly struck, I perceive, by this
adventure of your friend.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Strange coincidence! quite unaccountable!
There are agents at work in our dreams, M. de la Rochefoucault,
which we shall never see out of them, on this side the grave.
[<i>To himself.</i>] Sky-blue? no. Fleurs-de-lis? bah! bah! Patches?
I never wore one in my life.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> It well becomes your character for generosity,
M. La Fontaine, to look grave, and ponder, and ejaculate, on a
friend&#8217;s untoward accident, instead of laughing, as those who
little know you, might expect. I beg your pardon for relating
the occurrence.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Right or wrong, I cannot help laughing any
longer. Comical, by my faith! above the tiptop of comedy.
Excuse my flashes and dashes and rushes of merriment. Incontrollable!
incontrollable! Indeed the laughter is immoderate.
And you all the while are sitting as grave as a judge; I
mean a criminal one; who has nothing to do but to keep up
his popularity by sending his rogues to the gallows. The civil
indeed have much weighty matter on their minds: they must
displease one party: and sometimes a doubt arises whether the
fairer hand or the fuller shall turn the balance.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> I congratulate you on the return of your
gravity and composure.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Seriously now: all my lifetime I have been the
plaything of dreams. Sometimes they have taken such possession
of me, that nobody could persuade me afterward they
were other than real events. Some are very oppressive, very
painful, M. de la Rochefoucault! I have never been able,
altogether, to disembarrass my head of the most wonderful
vision that ever took possession of any man&#8217;s. There are some
truly important differences, but in many respects this laughable
adventure of my innocent, honest friend Moli&egrave;re seemed to have
befallen myself. I can only account for it by having heard the
tale when I was half asleep.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Nothing more probable.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> You absolutely have relieved me from an
incubus.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> I do not yet see how.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> No longer ago than when you entered this
chamber, I would have sworn that I myself had gone to the
Louvre, that I myself had been commanded to attend the
dauphin, that I myself had come into his presence, had fallen
on my knee, and cried, &#8216;Peste! o&ugrave; est donc le livre?&#8217; Ah,
M. de la Rochefoucault, permit me to embrace you: this is
really to find a friend at court.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> My visit is even more auspicious than I could
have ventured to expect: it was chiefly for the purpose of asking
your permission to make another at my return to Paris.... I
am forced to go into the country on some family affairs: but
hearing that you have spoken favourably of my <i>Maxims</i>, I
presume to express my satisfaction and delight at your good
opinion.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Pray, M. de la Rochefoucault, do me the favour
to continue here a few minutes. I would gladly reason with
you on some of your doctrines.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> For the pleasure of hearing your sentiments
on the topics I have treated, I will, although it is late, steal a
few minutes from the court, of which I must take my leave on
parting for the province.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Are you quite certain that all your <i>Maxims</i>
are true, or, what is of greater consequence, that they are all
original? I have lately read a treatise written by an Englishman,
Mr. Hobbes; so loyal a man that, while others tell you
kings are appointed by God, he tells you God is appointed by
kings.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Ah! such are precisely the men we want.
If he establishes this verity, the rest will follow.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> He does not seem to care so much about the
rest. In his treatise I find the ground-plan of your chief
positions.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> I have indeed looked over his publication; and
we agree on the natural depravity of man.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Reconsider your expression. It appears to me
that what is natural is not depraved: that depravity is deflection
from nature. Let it pass: I cannot, however, concede to you
that the generality of men are bad. Badness is accidental,
like disease. We find more tempers good than bad, where
proper care is taken in proper time.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Care is not nature.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Nature is soon inoperative without it; so soon
indeed as to allow no opportunity for experiment or hypothesis.
Life itself requires care, and more continually than tempers
and morals do. The strongest body ceases to be a body in a
few days without a supply of food. When we speak of men
being naturally bad or good, we mean susceptible and retentive
and communicative of them. In this case (and there can be
no other true or ostensible one) I believe that the more are good;
and nearly in the same proportion as there are animals and
plants produced healthy and vigorous than wayward and weakly.
Strange is the opinion of Mr. Hobbes, that, when God hath
poured so abundantly His benefits on other creatures, the only
one capable of great good should be uniformly disposed to
greater evil.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Yet Holy Writ, to which Hobbes would
reluctantly appeal, countenances the supposition.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> The Jews, above all nations, were morose and
splenetic. Nothing is holy to me that lessens in my view the
beneficence of my Creator. If you could show Him ungentle
and unkind in a single instance, you would render myriads of
men so, throughout the whole course of their lives, and those too
among the most religious. The less that people talk about
God the better. He has left us a design to fill up: He has placed
the canvas, the colours, and the pencils, within reach; His directing
hand is over ours incessantly; it is our business to follow it,
and neither to turn round and argue with our Master, nor to kiss
and fondle Him. We must mind our lesson, and not neglect
our time: for the room is closed early, and the lights are suspended
in another, where no one works. If every man would
do all the good he might within an hour&#8217;s walk from his house,
he would live the happier and the longer: for nothing is so
conducive to longevity as the union of activity and content.
But, like children, we deviate from the road, however well we
know it, and run into mire and puddles in despite of frown and
ferule.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Go on, M. La Fontaine! pray go on. We are
walking in the same labyrinth, always within call, always within
sight of each other. We set out at its two extremities, and shall
meet at last.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> I doubt it. From deficiency of care proceed
many vices, both in men and children, and more still from care
taken improperly. Mr. Hobbes attributes not only the order
and peace of society, but equity and moderation and every
other virtue, to the coercion and restriction of the laws. The
laws, as now constituted, do a great deal of good; they also do
a great deal of mischief. They transfer more property from the
right owner in six months than all the thieves of the kingdom
do in twelve. What the thieves take they soon disseminate
abroad again; what the laws take they hoard. The thief takes
a part of your property: he who prosecutes the thief for you takes
another part: he who condemns the thief goes to the tax-gatherer
and takes the third. Power has been hitherto occupied in no
employment but in keeping down Wisdom. Perhaps the time
may come when Wisdom shall exert her energy in repressing the
sallies of Power.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> I think it more probable that they will agree;
that they will call together their servants of all liveries, to
collect what they can lay their hands upon; and that meanwhile
they will sit together like good housewives, making nets from
our purses to cover the coop for us. If you would be plump
and in feather, pick up your millet and be quiet in your darkness.
Speculate on nothing here below, and I promise you a nosegay
in Paradise.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Believe me, I shall be most happy to receive it
there at your hands, my lord duke.</p>

<p>The greater number of men, I am inclined to think, with all
the defects of education, all the frauds committed on their
credulity, all the advantages taken of their ignorance and
supineness, are disposed, on most occasions, rather to virtue
than to vice, rather to the kindly affections than the unkindly,
rather to the social than the selfish.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Here we differ: and were my opinion the same
as yours, my book would be little read and less commended.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Why think so?</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> For this reason. Every man likes to hear evil
of all men: every man is delighted to take the air of the common,
though not a soul will consent to stand within his own allotment.
No enclosure act! no finger-posts! You may call every
creature under heaven fool and rogue, and your auditor will
join with you heartily: hint to him the slightest of his own
defects or foibles, and he draws the rapier. You and he are the
judges of the world, but not its denizens.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Mr. Hobbes has taken advantage of these
weaknesses. In his dissertation he betrays the timidity and
malice of his character. It must be granted he reasons well,
according to the view he has taken of things; but he has given
no proof whatever that his view is a correct one. I will believe
that it is, when I am persuaded that sickness is the natural
state of the body, and health the unnatural. If you call him a
sound philosopher, you may call a mummy a sound man. Its
darkness, its hardness, its forced uprightness, and the place in
which you find it, may commend it to you; give me rather some
weakness and peccability, with vital warmth and human sympathies.
A shrewd reasoner in one thing, a sound philosopher
is another. I admire your power and precision. Monks will
admonish us how little the author of the <i>Maxims</i> knows of the
world; and heads of colleges will cry out &#8216;a libel on human
nature!&#8217; but when they hear your titles, and, above all, your
credit at court, they will cast back cowl, and peruke, and lick
your boots. You start with great advantages. Throwing off
from a dukedom, you are sure of enjoying, if not the tongue of
these puzzlers, the full cry of the more animating, and will
certainly be as long-lived as the imperfection of our language
will allow. I consider your <i>Maxims</i> as a broken ridge of hills,
on the shady side of which you are fondest of taking your
exercise: but the same ridge hath also a sunny one. You
attribute (let me say it again) all actions to self-interest. Now,
a sentiment of interest must be preceded by calculation, long or
brief, right or erroneous. Tell me then in what region lies the
origin of that pleasure which a family in the country feels on
the arrival of an unexpected friend. I say a family in the
country; because the sweetest souls, like the sweetest flowers,
soon canker in cities, and no purity is rarer there than the purity
of delight. If I may judge from the few examples I have been
in a position to see, no earthly one can be greater. There are
pleasures which lie near the surface, and which are blocked up
by artificial ones, or are diverted by some mechanical scheme,
or are confined by some stiff evergreen vista of low advantage.
But these pleasures do occasionally burst forth in all their
brightness; and, if ever you shall by chance find one of them,
you will sit by it, I hope, complacently and cheerfully, and turn
toward it the kindliest aspect of your meditations.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Many, indeed most people, will differ from
me. Nothing is quite the same to the intellect of any two
men, much less of all. When one says to another, &#8216;I am entirely
of your opinion,&#8217; he uses in general an easy and indifferent
phrase, believing in its accuracy, without examination, without
thought. The nearest resemblance in opinions, if we could
trace every line of it, would be found greatly more divergent
than the nearest in the human form or countenance, and in the
same proportion as the varieties of mental qualities are more
numerous and fine than of the bodily. Hence I do not expect
nor wish that my opinions should in all cases be similar to those
of others: but in many I shall be gratified if, by just degrees and
after a long survey, those of others approximate to mine. Nor
does this my sentiment spring from a love of power, as in many
good men quite unconsciously, when they would make proselytes,
since I shall see few and converse with fewer of them, and profit
in no way by their adherence and favour; but it springs from a
natural and a cultivated love of all truths whatever, and from
a certainty that these delivered by me are conducive to the
happiness and dignity of man. You shake your head.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Make it out.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> I have pointed out to him at what passes he
hath deviated from his true interest, and where he hath mistaken
selfishness for generosity, coldness for judgment, contraction
of heart for policy, rank for merit, pomp for dignity;
of all mistakes, the commonest and the greatest. I am accused
of paradox and distortion. On paradox I shall only say, that
every new moral truth has been called so. Inexperienced
and negligent observers see no difference in the operations of
ravelling and unravelling: they never come close enough: they
despise plain work.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> The more we simplify things, the better we
descry their substances and qualities. A good writer will not
coil them up and press them into the narrowest possible space,
nor macerate them into such particles that nothing shall be
remaining of their natural contexture. You are accused of
this too, by such as have forgotten your title-page, and who look
for treatises where maxims only have been promised. Some
of them perhaps are spinning out sermons and dissertations from
the poorest paragraph in the volume.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Let them copy and write as they please;
against or for, modestly or impudently. I have hitherto
had no assailant who is not of too slender a make to be detained
an hour in the stocks he had unwarily put his foot into. If
you hear of any, do not tell of them. On the subjects of my
remarks, had others thought as I do, my labour would have
been spared me. I am ready to point out the road where I
know it, to whosoever wants it; but I walk side by side with
few or none.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> We usually like those roads which show us the
fronts of our friends&#8217; houses and the pleasure-grounds about
them, and the smooth garden-walks, and the trim espaliers,
and look at them with more satisfaction than at the docks and
nettles that are thrown in heaps behind. The <i>Offices</i> of Cicero
are imperfect; yet who would not rather guide his children by
them than by the line and compass of harder-handed guides;
such as Hobbes for instance?</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Imperfect as some gentlemen in hoods may
call the <i>Offices</i>, no founder of a philosophical or of a religious
sect has been able to add to them anything important.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Pity! that Cicero carried with him no better
authorities than reason and humanity. He neither could
work miracles, nor damn you for disbelieving them. Had he
lived fourscore years later, who knows but he might have been
another Simon Peter, and have talked Hebrew as fluently as
Latin, all at once! Who knows but we might have heard of his
patrimony! who knows but our venerable popes might have
claimed dominion from him, as descendant from the kings of
Rome!</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> The hint, some centuries ago, would have
made your fortune, and that saintly cat there would have
kittened in a mitre.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Alas! the hint could have done nothing: Cicero
could not have lived later.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> I warrant him. Nothing is easier to correct
than chronology. There is not a lady in Paris, nor a jockey in
Normandy, that is not eligible to a professor&#8217;s chair in it. I
have seen a man&#8217;s ancestor, whom nobody ever saw before,
spring back over twenty generations. Our Vatican Jupiters
have as little respect for old Chronos as the Cretan had: they
mutilate him when and where they think necessary, limp as
he may by the operation.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> When I think, as you make me do, how
ambitious men are, even those whose teeth are too loose (one
would fancy) for a bite at so hard an apple as the devil of
ambition offers them, I am inclined to believe that we are
actuated not so much by selfishness as you represent it, but under
another form, the love of power. Not to speak of territorial
dominion or political office, and such other things as we usually
class under its appurtenances, do we not desire an exclusive
control over what is beautiful and lovely? the possession of
pleasant fields, of well-situated houses, of cabinets, of images,
of pictures, and indeed of many things pleasant to see but useless
to possess; even of rocks, of streams, and of fountains? These
things, you will tell me, have their utility. True, but not to
the wisher, nor does the idea of it enter his mind. Do not we
wish that the object of our love should be devoted to us only;
and that our children should love us better than their brothers
and sisters, or even than the mother who bore them? Love
would be arrayed in the purple robe of sovereignty, mildly as
he may resolve to exercise his power.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Many things which appear to be incontrovertible
are such for their age only, and must yield to others
which, in their age, are equally so. There are only a few points
that are always above the waves. Plain truths, like plain dishes,
are commended by everybody, and everybody leaves them
whole. If it were not even more impertinent and presumptuous
to praise a great writer in his presence than to censure him in
his absence, I would venture to say that your prose, from the
few specimens you have given of it, is equal to your verse.
Yet, even were I the possessor of such a style as yours, I would
never employ it to support my <i>Maxims</i>. You would think a
writer very impudent and self-sufficient who should quote
his own works: to defend them is doing more. We are the
worst auxiliaries in the world to the opinions we have brought
into the field. Our business is, to measure the ground, and to
calculate the forces; then let them try their strength. If the
weak assails me, he thinks me weak; if the strong, he thinks me
strong. He is more likely to compute ill his own vigour than
mine. At all events, I love inquiry, even when I myself sit
down. And I am not offended in my walks if my visitor asks
me whither does that alley lead. It proves that he is ready to
go on with me; that he sees some space before him; and that he
believes there may be something worth looking after.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> You have been standing a long time, my lord
duke: I must entreat you to be seated.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Excuse me, my dear M. la Fontaine; I would
much rather stand.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Mercy on us! have you been upon your legs
ever since you rose to leave me?</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> A change of position is agreeable: a friend
always permits it.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Sad doings! sad oversight! The other two chairs
were sent yesterday evening to be scoured and mended. But
that dog is the best tempered dog! an angel of a dog, I do
assure you; he would have gone down in a moment, at a word.
I am quite ashamed of myself for such inattention. With your
sentiments of friendship for me, why could you not have taken
the liberty to shove him gently off, rather than give me this
uneasiness?</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> My true and kind friend! we authors are too
sedentary; we are heartily glad of standing to converse, whenever
we can do it without any restraint on our acquaintance.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> I must reprove that animal when he uncurls
his body. He seems to be dreaming of Paradise and houris.
Ay, twitch thy ear, my child! I wish at my heart there were
as troublesome a fly about the other: God forgive me! The
rogue covers all my clean linen! shirt and cravat! what cares he!</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Dogs are not very modest.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Never say that, M. de la Rochefoucault! The
most modest people upon earth! Look at a dog&#8217;s eyes, and he
half closes them, or gently turns them away, with a motion of
the lips, which he licks languidly, and of the tail, which he stirs
tremulously, begging your forbearance. I am neither blind nor
indifferent to the defects of these good and generous creatures.
They are subject to many such as men are subject to: among
the rest, they disturb the neighbourhood in the discussion
of their private causes; they quarrel and fight on small motives,
such as a little bad food, or a little vainglory, or the sex. But
it must be something present or near that excites them;
and they calculate not the extent of evil they may do or
suffer.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Certainly not: how should dogs calculate?</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> I know nothing of the process. I am unable
to inform you how they leap over hedges and brooks, with
exertion just sufficient, and no more. In regard to honour and
a sense of dignity, let me tell you, a dog accepts the subsidies
of his friends, but never claims them: a dog would not take the
field to obtain power for a son, but would leave the son to obtain
it by his own activity and prowess. He conducts his visitor or
inmate out a-hunting, and makes a present of the game to him
as freely as an emperor to an elector. Fond as he is of slumber,
which is indeed one of the pleasantest and best things in the
universe, particularly after dinner, he shakes it off as willingly
as he would a gadfly, in order to defend his master from theft
or violence. Let the robber or assailant speak as courteously
as he may, he waives your diplomatical terms, gives his reasons
in plain language, and makes war. I could say many other
things to his advantage; but I never was malicious, and would
rather let both parties plead for themselves; give me the dog,
however.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Faith! I will give you both, and never boast of
my largess in so doing.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> I trust I have removed from you the suspicion
of selfishness in my client, and I feel it quite as easy to make
a properer disposal of another ill attribute, namely cruelty,
which we vainly try to shuffle off our own shoulders upon others,
by employing the offensive and most unjust term, brutality.
But to convince you of my impartiality, now I have defended
the dog from the first obloquy, I will defend the man from the
last, hoping to make you think better of each. What you
attribute to cruelty, both while we are children and afterward,
may be assigned, for the greater part, to curiosity. Cruelty
tends to the extinction of life, the dissolution of matter, the
imprisonment and sepulture of truth; and if it were our ruling
and chief propensity, the human race would have been extinguished
in a few centuries after its appearance. Curiosity,
in its primary sense, implies care and consideration.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Words often deflect from their primary sense.
We find the most curious men the most idle and silly, the least
observant and conservative.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> So we think; because we see every hour the
idly curious, and not the strenuously; we see only the persons
of the one set, and only the works of the other.</p>

<p>More is heard of cruelty than of curiosity, because while
curiosity is silent both in itself and about its object, cruelty
on most occasions is like the wind, boisterous in itself, and
exciting a murmur and bustle in all the things it moves among.
Added to which, many of the higher topics whereto our curiosity
would turn, are intercepted from it by the policy of our guides
and rulers; while the principal ones on which cruelty is most
active, are pointed to by the sceptre and the truncheon, and
wealth and dignity are the rewards of their attainment. What
perversion! He who brings a bullock into a city for its sustenance
is called a butcher, and nobody has the civility to take off
the hat to him, although knowing him as perfectly as I know
Matthieu le Mince, who served me with those fine kidneys
you must have remarked in passing through the kitchen:
on the contrary, he who reduces the same city to famine is
styled M. le G&eacute;n&eacute;ral or M. le Mar&eacute;chal, and gentlemen like you,
unprejudiced (as one would think) and upright, make room for
him in the antechamber.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> He obeys orders without the degrading
influence of any passion.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Then he commits a baseness the more, a cruelty
the greater. He goes off at another man&#8217;s setting, as ingloriously
as a rat-trap: he produces the worst effects of fury, and feels
none: a Cain unirritated by a brother&#8217;s incense.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> I would hide from you this little rapier, which,
like the barber&#8217;s pole, I have often thought too obtrusive in
the streets.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Never shall I think my countrymen half civilized
while on the dress of a courtier is hung the instrument of a cut-throat.
How deplorably feeble must be that honour which
requires defending at every hour of the day!</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Ingenious as you are, M. La Fontaine, I do not
believe that, on this subject, you could add anything to what
you have spoken already; but really, I do think one of the most
instructive things in the world would be a dissertation on dress
by you.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Nothing can be devised more commodious
than the dress in fashion. Perukes have fallen among us
by the peculiar dispensation of Providence. As in all the
regions of the globe the indigenous have given way to stronger
creatures, so have they (partly at least) on the human head.
At present the wren and the squirrel are dominant there.
Whenever I have a mind for a filbert, I have only to shake my
foretop. Improvement does not end in that quarter. I might
forget to take my pinch of snuff when it would do me good, unless
I saw a store of it on another&#8217;s cravat. Furthermore, the slit
in the coat behind tells in a moment what it was made for: a
thing of which, in regard to ourselves, the best preachers have to
remind us all our lives: then the central part of our habiliment
has either its loop-hole or its portcullis in the opposite direction,
still more demonstrative. All these are for very mundane
purposes: but Religion and Humanity have whispered some
later utilities. We pray the more commodiously, and of course
the more frequently, for rolling up a royal ell of stocking round
about our knees: and our high-heeled shoes must surely have been
worn by some angel, to save those insects which the flat-footed
would have crushed to death.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Ah! the good dog has awakened: he saw me
and my rapier, and ran away. Of what breed is he? for I know
nothing of dogs.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> And write so well!</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Is he a truffler?</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> No, not he; but quite as innocent.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Something of the shepherd-dog, I suspect.</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> Nor that neither; although he fain would make
you believe it. Indeed he is very like one: pointed nose, pointed
ears, apparently stiff, but readily yielding; long hair, particularly
about the neck; noble tail over his back, three curls deep,
exceedingly pleasant to stroke down again; straw-colour all
above, white all below. He might take it ill if you looked for
it; but so it is, upon my word: an ermeline might envy it.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> What are his pursuits?</p>

<p><i>La Fontaine.</i> As to pursuit and occupation, he is good for
nothing. In fact, I like those dogs best ... and those men too.</p>

<p><i>Rochefoucault.</i> Send Nanon then for a pair of silk stockings,
and mount my carriage with me: it stops at the Louvre.</p>

<h2><a name="LUCIAN_AND_TIMOTHEUS" id="LUCIAN_AND_TIMOTHEUS"></a>LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS</h2>


<p><i>Timotheus.</i> I am delighted, my Cousin Lucian, to observe
how popular are become your <i>Dialogues of the Dead</i>. Nothing
can be so gratifying and satisfactory to a rightly disposed mind,
as the subversion of imposture by the force of ridicule. It
hath scattered the crowd of heathen gods as if a thunderbolt
had fallen in the midst of them. Now, I am confident you never
would have assailed the false religion, unless you were prepared
for the reception of the true. For it hath always been an
indication of rashness and precipitancy, to throw down an
edifice before you have collected materials for reconstruction.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Of all metaphors and remarks, I believe this of yours,
my good cousin Timotheus, is the most trite, and pardon me if
I add, the most untrue. Surely we ought to remove an error
the instant we detect it, although it may be out of our competence
to state and establish what is right. A lie should be
exposed as soon as born: we are not to wait until a healthier
child is begotten. Whatever is evil in any way should be
abolished. The husbandman never hesitates to eradicate weeds,
or to burn them up, because he may not happen at the time to
carry a sack on his shoulder with wheat or barley in it. Even
if no wheat or barley is to be sown in future, the weeding and
burning are in themselves beneficial, and something better will
spring up.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> That is not so certain.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Doubt it as you may, at least you will allow that the
temporary absence of evil is an advantage.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> I think, O Lucian, you would reason much better
if you would come over to our belief.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I was unaware that belief is an encourager and guide
to reason.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Depend upon it, there can be no stability of truth,
no elevation of genius, without an unwavering faith in our holy
mysteries. Babes and sucklings who are blest with it, stand
higher, intellectually as well as morally, than stiff unbelievers
and proud sceptics.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I do not wonder that so many are firm holders of
this novel doctrine. It is pleasant to grow wise and virtuous
at so small an expenditure of thought or time. This saying of
yours is exactly what I heard spoken with angry gravity not
long ago.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Angry! no wonder! for it is impossible to keep our
patience when truths so incontrovertible are assailed. What
was your answer?</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> My answer was: If you talk in this manner, my
honest friend, you will excite a spirit of ridicule in the gravest
and most saturnine of men, who never had let a laugh out of
their breasts before. Lie to <i>me</i>, and welcome; but beware lest
your own heart take you to task for it, reminding you that both
anger and falsehood are reprehended by all religions, yours
included.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Lucian! Lucian! you have always been called
profane.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> For what? for having turned into ridicule the gods
whom you have turned out of house and home, and are reducing
to dust?</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Well; but you are equally ready to turn into
ridicule the true and holy.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> In other words, to turn myself into a fool. He
who brings ridicule to bear against Truth, finds in his hand a
blade without a hilt. The most sparkling and pointed flame of
wit flickers and expires against the incombustible walls of
her sanctuary.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Fine talking! Do you know, you have really
been called an atheist?</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Yes, yes; I know it well. But, in fact, I believe there
are almost as few atheists in the world as there are Christians.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> How! as few? Most of Europe, most of Asia,
most of Africa, is Christian.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Show me five men in each who obey the commands
of Christ, and I will show you five hundred in this very city
who observe the dictates of Pythagoras. Every Pythagorean
obeys his defunct philosopher; and almost every Christian disobeys
his living God. Where is there one who practises the
most important and the easiest of His commands, to abstain
from strife? Men easily and perpetually find something new
to quarrel about; but the objects of affection are limited in
number, and grow up scantily and slowly. Even a small house
is often too spacious for them, and there is a vacant seat at the
table. Religious men themselves, when the Deity has bestowed
on them everything they prayed for, discover, as a peculiar
gift of Providence, some fault in the actions or opinions of a
neighbour, and run it down, crying and shouting after it, with
more alacrity and more clamour than boys would a leveret or a
squirrel in the playground. Are our years and our intellects,
and the word of God itself, given us for this, O Timotheus?</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> A certain latitude, a liberal construction....</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Ay, ay! These &#8216;liberal constructions&#8217; let loose all
the worst passions into those &#8216;certain latitudes&#8217;. The priests
themselves, who ought to be the poorest, are the richest; who
ought to be the most obedient, are the most refractory and
rebellious. All trouble and all piety are vicarious. They send
missionaries, at the cost of others, into foreign lands, to teach
observances which they supersede at home. I have ridiculed
the puppets of all features, all colours, all sizes, by which an
impudent and audacious set of impostors have been gaining an
easy livelihood these two thousand years.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Gently! gently! Ours have not been at it yet
two hundred. We abolish all idolatry. We know that Jupiter
was not the father of gods and men: we know that Mars was not
the Lord of Hosts: we know who is: we are quite at ease upon
that question.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Are you so fanatical, my good Timotheus, as to
imagine that the Creator of the world cares a fig by what
appellation you adore Him? whether you call Him on one occasion
Jupiter, on another Apollo? I will not add Mars or Lord of
Hosts; for, wanting as I may be in piety, I am not, and never
was, so impious as to call the Maker the Destroyer; to call Him
Lord of Hosts who, according to your holiest of books, declared
so lately and so plainly that He permits no hosts at all; much less
will He take the command of one against another. Would any
man in his senses go down into the cellar, and seize first an
amphora from the right, and then an amphora from the left,
for the pleasure of breaking them in pieces, and of letting out
the wine he had taken the trouble to put in? We are not contented
with attributing to the gods our own infirmities; we make
them even more wayward, even more passionate, even more
exigent and more malignant: and then some of us try to coax
and cajole them, and others run away from them outright.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> No wonder: but only in regard to yours: and even
those are types.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> There are honest men who occupy their lives in discovering
types for all things.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Truly and rationally thou speakest now. Honest
men and wise men above their fellows are they, and the greatest
of all discoverers. There are many types above thy reach,
O Lucian!</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> And one which my mind, and perhaps yours also,
can comprehend. There is in Italy, I hear, on the border of
a quiet and beautiful lake, a temple dedicated to Diana; the
priests of which temple have murdered each his predecessor for
unrecorded ages.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> What of that? They were idolaters.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> They made the type, however: take it home with
you, and hang it up in your temple.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Why! you seem to have forgotten on a sudden
that I am a Christian: you are talking of the heathens.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> True! true! I am near upon eighty years of age, and
to my poor eyesight one thing looks very like another.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> You are too indifferent.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> No indeed. I love those best who quarrel least,
and who bring into public use the most civility and good
humour.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Our holy religion inculcates this duty especially.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Such being the case, a pleasant story will not be
thrown away upon you. Xenophanes, my townsman of Samosata,
was resolved to buy a new horse: he had tried him, and liked
him well enough. I asked him why he wished to dispose of
his old one, knowing how sure-footed he was, how easy in
his paces, and how quiet in his pasture. &#8216;Very true, O Lucian,&#8217;
said he; &#8216;the horse is a clever horse; noble eye, beautiful figure,
stately step; rather too fond of neighing and of shuffling a little
in the vicinity of a mare; but tractable and good tempered.&#8217;
&#8216;I would not have parted with him then,&#8217; said I. &#8216;The fact is,&#8217;
replied he, &#8216;my grandfather, whom I am about to visit, likes
no horses but what are <i>Saturnized</i>. To-morrow I begin my
journey: come and see me set out.&#8217; I went at the hour
appointed. The new purchase looked quiet and demure; but
<i>he</i> also pricked up his ears, and gave sundry other tokens of
equinity, when the more interesting part of his fellow-creatures
came near him. As the morning oats began to operate, he grew
more and more unruly, and snapped at one friend of Xenophanes,
and sidled against another, and gave a kick at a third.
&#8216;All in play! all in play!&#8217; said Xenophanes; &#8216;his nature is more
of a lamb&#8217;s than a horse&#8217;s.&#8217; However, these mute salutations
being over, away went Xenophanes. In the evening, when my
lamp had just been replenished for the commencement of my
studies, my friend came in striding as if he were still across
the saddle. &#8216;I am apprehensive, O Xenophanes,&#8217; said I, &#8216;your
new acquaintance has disappointed you.&#8217; &#8216;Not in the least,&#8217;
answered he. &#8216;I do assure you, O Lucian! he is the very horse
I was looking out for.&#8217; On my requesting him to be seated,
he no more thought of doing so than if it had been in the presence
of the Persian king. I then handed my lamp to him, telling
him (as was true) it contained all the oil I had in the house,
and protesting I should be happier to finish my Dialogue in the
morning. He took the lamp into my bedroom, and appeared
to be much refreshed on his return. Nevertheless, he treated
his chair with great delicacy and circumspection, and evidently
was afraid of breaking it by too sudden a descent. I did not
revert to the horse: but he went on of his own accord. &#8216;I
declare to you, O Lucian! it is impossible for me to be mistaken
in a palfrey. My new one is the only one in Samosata that
could carry me at one stretch to my grandfather&#8217;s.&#8217; &#8216;But
<i>has</i> he?&#8217; said I, timidly. &#8216;No; he has not yet,&#8217; answered my
friend. &#8216;To-morrow, then, I am afraid, we really must lose you.&#8217;
&#8216;No,&#8217; said he; &#8216;the horse does trot hard: but he is the better for
that: I shall soon get used to him.&#8217; In fine, my worthy friend
deferred his visit to his grandfather: his rides were neither
long nor frequent: he was ashamed to part with his purchase,
boasted of him everywhere, and, humane as he is by nature,
could almost have broken on the cross the quiet contented
owner of old Bucephalus.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Am I to understand by this, O Cousin Lucian,
that I ought to be contented with the impurities of paganism?</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Unless you are very unreasonable. A moderate man
finds plenty in it.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> We abominate the Deities who patronize them,
and we hurl down the images of the monsters.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Sweet cousin! be tenderer to my feelings. In such
a tempest as this, my spark of piety may be blown out. Hold
your hand cautiously before it, until I can find my way. Believe
me, no Deities (out of their own houses) patronize immorality;
none patronize unruly passions, least of all the fierce and
ferocious. In my opinion, you are wrong in throwing down the
images of those among them who look on you benignly: the
others I give up to your discretion. But I think it impossible
to stand habitually in the presence of a sweet and open countenance,
graven or depicted, without in some degree partaking of
the character it expresses. Never tell any man that he can
derive no good, in his devotions, from this or from that: abolish
neither hope nor gratitude.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> God is offended at vain efforts to represent Him.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> No such thing, my dear Timotheus. If you knew
Him at all, you would not talk of Him so irreverently. He is
pleased, I am convinced, at every effort to resemble Him, at
every wish to remind both ourselves and others of His benefits.
You cannot think so often of Him without an effigy.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> What likeness is there in the perishable to the
Unperishable?</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I see no reason why there may not be a similitude.
All that the senses can comprehend may be represented by any
material; clay or fig-tree, bronze or ivory, porphyry or gold.
Indeed I have a faint remembrance that, according to your
sacred volumes, man was made by God after His own image.
If so, man&#8217;s intellectual powers are worthily exercised in attempting
to collect all that is beautiful, serene, and dignified, and to
bring Him back to earth again by showing Him the noblest of
His gifts, the work most like His own. Surely He cannot hate
or abandon those who thus cherish His memory, and thus
implore His regard. Perishable and imperfect is everything
human: but in these very qualities I find the best reason for
striving to attain what is least so. Would not any father be
gratified by seeing his child attempt to delineate his features?
And would not the gratification be rather increased than
diminished by his incapacity? How long shall the narrow
mind of man stand between goodness and omnipotence? Perhaps
the effigy of your ancestor Isknos is unlike him; whether
it is or no, you cannot tell; but you keep it in your hall, and would
be angry if anybody broke it to pieces or defaced it. Be quite
sure there are many who think as much of their gods as you
think of your ancestor Isknos, and who see in their images as
good a likeness. Let men have their own way, especially their
way to the temples. It is easier to drive them out of one road
than into another. Our judicious and good-humoured Trajan
has found it necessary on many occasions to chastise the law-breakers
of your sect, indifferent as he is what gods are worshipped,
so long as their followers are orderly and decorous.
The fiercest of the Dacians never knocked off Jupiter&#8217;s beard, or
broke an arm off Venus; and the emperor will hardly tolerate
in those who have received a liberal education what he would
punish in barbarians. Do not wear out his patience: try rather
to imitate his equity, his equanimity, and forbearance.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> I have been listening to you with much attention,
O Lucian! for I seldom have heard you speak with such gravity.
And yet, O Cousin Lucian! I really do find in you a sad
deficiency of that wisdom which alone is of any value. You
talk of Trajan! what is Trajan?</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> A beneficent citizen, an impartial judge, a sagacious
ruler; the comrade of every brave soldier, the friend and
associate of every man eminent in genius, throughout his empire,
the empire of the world. All arts, all sciences, all philosophies,
all religions, are protected by him. Wherefore his name will
flourish, when the proudest of these have perished in the land
of Egypt. Philosophies and religions will strive, struggle, and
suffocate one another. Priesthoods, I know not how many, are
quarrelling and scuffling in the street at this instant, all calling
on Trajan to come and knock an antagonist on the head; and
the most peaceful of them, as it wishes to be thought, proclaiming
him an infidel for turning a deaf ear to its imprecations.
Mankind was never so happy as under his guidance; and he has
nothing now to do but to put down the battles of the gods.
If they must fight it out, he will insist on our neutrality.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> He has no authority and no influence over us in
matters of faith. A wise and upright man, whose serious
thoughts lead him forward to religion, will never be turned
aside from it by any worldly consideration or any human
force.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> True: but mankind is composed not entirely of the
upright and the wise. I suspect that we may find some, here
and there, who are rather too fond of novelties in the furniture
of temples; and I have observed that new sects are apt to warp,
crack, and split, under the heat they generate. Our homely old
religion has run into fewer quarrels, ever since the Centaurs and
Lapiths (whose controversy was on a subject quite comprehensible),
than yours has engendered in twenty years.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> We shall obviate that inconvenience by electing
a supreme Pontiff to decide all differences. It has been seriously
thought about long ago: and latterly we have been making out
an ideal series down to the present day, in order that our successors
in the ministry may have stepping-stones up to the
fountain-head. At first the disseminators of our doctrines were
equal in their commission; we do not approve of this any longer,
for reasons of our own.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> You may shut, one after another, all our other
temples, but, I plainly see, you will never shut the temple of
Janus. The Roman Empire will never lose its pugnacious
character while your sect exists. The only danger is, lest the
fever rage internally and consume the vitals. If you sincerely
wish your religion to be long-lived, maintain in it the spirit
of its constitution, and keep it patient, humble, abstemious,
domestic, and zealous only in the services of humanity. Whenever
the higher of your priesthood shall attain the riches they
are aiming at, the people will envy their possessions and revolt
from their impostures. Do not let them seize upon the palace,
and shove their God again into the manger.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Lucian! Lucian! I call this impiety.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> So do I, and shudder at its consequences. Caverns
which at first look inviting, the roof at the aperture green with
overhanging ferns and clinging mosses, then glittering with
native gems and with water as sparkling and pellucid, freshening
the air all around; these caverns grow darker and closer, until
you find yourself among animals that shun the daylight, adhering
to the walls, hissing along the bottom, flapping, screeching,
gaping, glaring, making you shrink at the sounds, and sicken
at the smells, and afraid to advance or retreat.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> To what can this refer? Our caverns open on
verdure, and terminate in veins of gold.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Veins of gold, my good Timotheus, such as your
excavations have opened and are opening, in the spirit of avarice
and ambition, will be washed (or as you would say, <i>purified</i>)
in streams of blood. Arrogance, intolerance, resistance to
authority and contempt of law, distinguish your aspiring
sectarians from the other subjects of the empire.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Blindness hath often a calm and composed
countenance; but, my Cousin Lucian! it usually hath also the
advantage of a cautious and a measured step. It hath pleased
God to blind you, like all the other adversaries of our faith;
but He has given you no staff to lean upon. You object against
us the very vices from which we are peculiarly exempt.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Then it is all a story, a fable, a fabrication, about one
of your earlier leaders cutting off with his sword a servant&#8217;s
ear? If the accusation is true, the offence is heavy. For not
only was the wounded man innocent of any provocation, but
he is represented as being in the service of the high priest at
Jerusalem. Moreover, from the direction and violence of the
blow, it is evident that his life was aimed at. According to law,
you know, my dear cousin, all the party might have been
condemned to death, as accessories to an attempt at murder.
I am unwilling to think so unfavourably of your sect; nor indeed
do I see the possibility that, in such an outrage, the principal
could be pardoned. For any man but a soldier to go about
armed is against the Roman law, which, on that head, as on
many others, is borrowed from the Athenian; and it is incredible
that in any civilized country so barbarous a practice can be
tolerated. Travellers do indeed relate that, in certain parts of
India, there are princes at whose courts even civilians are armed.
But <i>traveller</i> has occasionally the same signification as <i>liar</i>,
and <i>India</i> as <i>fable</i>. However, if the practice really does exist
in that remote and rarely visited country, it must be in some
region of it very far beyond the Indus or the Ganges: for
the nations situated between those rivers are, and were in
the reign of Alexander, and some thousand years before his
birth, as civilized as the Europeans; nay, incomparably more
courteous, more industrious, and more pacific; the three grand
criterions.</p>

<p>But answer my question: is there any foundation for so
mischievous a report?</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> There was indeed, so to say, an ear, or something
of the kind, abscinded; probably by mistake. But high priests&#8217;
servants are propense to follow the swaggering gait of their
masters, and to carry things with a high hand, in such wise as
to excite the choler of the most quiet. If you knew the character
of the eminently holy man who punished the atrocious
insolence of that bloody-minded wretch, you would be sparing
of your animadversions. We take him for our model.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I see you do.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> We proclaim him Prince of the Apostles.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I am the last in the world to question his princely
qualifications; but, if I might advise you, it should be to follow
in preference Him whom you acknowledge to be an unerring
guide; who delivered to you His ordinances with His own
hand, equitable, plain, explicit, compendious, and complete; who
committed no violence, who countenanced no injustice, whose
compassion was without weakness, whose love was without
frailty, whose life was led in humility, in purity, in beneficence,
and, at the end, laid down in obedience to His Father&#8217;s will.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Ah, Lucian! what strangely imperfect notions!
all that is little.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Enough to follow.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Not enough to compel others. I did indeed
hope, O Lucian! that you would again come forward with the
irresistible arrows of your wit, and unite with us against our
adversaries. By what you have just spoken, I doubt no longer
that you approve of the doctrines inculcated by the blessed
Founder of our religion.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> To the best of my understanding.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> So ardent is my desire for the salvation of your
precious soul, O my cousin! that I would devote many hours
of every day to disputation with you on the principal points of
our Christian controversy.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Many thanks, my kind Timotheus! But I think
the blessed Founder of your religion very strictly forbade that
there should be <i>any</i> points of controversy. Not only has He
prohibited them on the doctrines He delivered, but on everything
else. Some of the most obstinate might never have doubted
of His Divinity, if the conduct of His followers had not repelled
them from the belief of it. How can they imagine you sincere
when they see you disobedient? It is in vain for you to protest
that you worship the God of Peace, when you are found daily
in the courts and market-places with clenched fists and bloody
noses. I acknowledge the full value of your offer; but really I
am as anxious for the salvation of your precious time as you
appear to be for the salvation of my precious soul, particularly
since I am come to the conclusion that souls cannot be lost,
and that time can.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> We mean by <i>salvation</i> exemption from eternal
torments.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Among all my old gods and their children, morose
as some of the senior are, and mischievous as are some of the
junior, I have never represented the worst of them as capable
of inflicting such atrocity. Passionate and capricious and unjust
are several of them; but a skin stripped off the shoulder, and a
liver tossed to a vulture, are among the worst of their inflictions.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> This is scoffing.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Nobody but an honest man has a right to scoff at
anything.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> And yet people of a very different cast are usually
those who scoff the most.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> We are apt to push forward at that which we are
without: the low-born at titles and distinctions, the silly at
wit, the knave at the semblance of probity. But I was about
to remark, that an honest man may fairly scoff at all philosophies
and religions which are proud, ambitious, intemperate, and
contradictory. The thing most adverse to the spirit and
essence of them all is falsehood. It is the business of the
philosophical to seek truth: it is the office of the religious to
worship her; under what name is unimportant. The falsehood
that the tongue commits is slight in comparison with what is
conceived by the heart, and executed by the whole man, throughout
life. If, professing love and charity to the human race at
large, I quarrel day after day with my next neighbour; if, professing
that the rich can never see God, I spend in the luxuries
of my household a talent monthly; if, professing to place so much
confidence in His word, that, in regard to wordly weal, I need
take no care for to-morrow, I accumulate stores even beyond
what would be necessary, though I quite distrusted both His
providence and His veracity; if, professing that &#8216;he who giveth
to the poor lendeth to the Lord&#8217;, I question the Lord&#8217;s security,
and haggle with Him about the amount of the loan; if, professing
that I am their steward, I keep ninety-nine parts in the hundred
as the emolument of my stewardship; how, when God hates
liars and punishes defrauders, shall I, and other such thieves
and hypocrites, fare hereafter?</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Let us hope there are few of them.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> We cannot hope against what is: we may, however,
hope that in future these will be fewer; but never while the
overseers of a priesthood look for offices out of it, taking the
lead in politics, in debate, and strife. Such men bring to ruin
all religion, but their own first, and raise unbelievers not only
in Divine Providence, but in human faith.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> If they leave the altar for the market-place, the
sanctuary for the senate-house, and agitate party questions
instead of Christian verities, everlasting punishments await
them.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Everlasting?</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Certainly: at the very least. I rank it next to
heresy in the catalogue of sins; and the Church supports my
opinion.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I have no measure for ascertaining the distance
between the opinions and practices of men; I only know that
they stand widely apart in all countries on the most important
occasions; but this newly-hatched word <i>heresy</i>, alighting on my
ear, makes me rub it. A beneficent God descends on earth in
the human form, to redeem us from the slavery of sin, from the
penalty of our passions: can you imagine He will punish an error
in opinion, or even an obstinacy in unbelief, with everlasting
torments? Supposing it highly criminal to refuse to weigh
a string of arguments, or to cross-question a herd of witnesses,
on a subject which no experience has warranted and no sagacity
can comprehend; supposing it highly criminal to be contented
with the religion which our parents taught us, which they
bequeathed to us as the most precious of possessions, and which
it would have broken their hearts if they had foreseen we should
cast aside; yet are eternal pains the just retribution of what at
worst is but indifference and supineness?</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Our religion has clearly this advantage over yours:
it teaches us to regulate our passions.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Rather say it <i>tells</i> us. I believe all religions do the
same; some indeed more emphatically and primarily than others;
but <i>that</i> indeed would be incontestably of Divine origin, and
acknowledged at once by the most sceptical, which should
thoroughly teach it. Now, my friend Timotheus, I think you
are about seventy-five years of age.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Nigh upon it.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Seventy-five years, according to my calculation, are
equivalent to seventy-five gods and goddesses in regulating
our passions for us, if we speak of the amatory, which are always
thought in every stage of life the least to be pardoned.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Execrable!</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I am afraid the sourest hang longest on the tree.
Mimnermus says:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In early youth we often sigh</span><br />
<span class="i0">Because our pulses beat so high;</span><br />
<span class="i0">All this we conquer, and at last</span><br />
<span class="i0">We sigh that we are grown so chaste.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Swine!</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> No animal sighs oftener or louder. But, my dear
cousin, the quiet swine is less troublesome and less odious than
the grumbling and growling and fierce hyena, which will not let
the dead rest in their graves. We may be merry with the
follies and even the vices of men, without doing or wishing
them harm; punishment should come from the magistrate,
not from us. If we are to give pain to any one because he
thinks differently from us, we ought to begin by inflicting a
few smart stripes on ourselves; for both upon light and upon
grave occasions, if we have thought much and often, our opinions
must have varied. We are always fond of seizing and managing
what appertains to others. In the savage state all belongs to
all. Our neighbours the Arabs, who stand between barbarism
and civilization, waylay travellers, and plunder their equipage
and their gold. The wilier marauders in Alexandria start up
from under the shadow of temples, force us to change our habiliments
for theirs, and strangle us with fingers dipped in holy
water if we say they sit uneasily.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> This is not the right view of things.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> That is never the right view which lets in too much
light. About two centuries have elapsed since your religion
was founded. Show me the pride it has humbled; show me the
cruelty it has mitigated; show me the lust it has extinguished
or repressed. I have now been living ten years in Alexandria;
and you never will accuse me, I think, of any undue partiality
for the system in which I was educated; yet, from all my
observation, I find no priest or elder, in your community, wise,
tranquil, firm, and sedate as Epicurus, and Carneades, and Zeno,
and Epictetus; or indeed in the same degree as some who were
often called forth into political and military life; Epaminondas,
for instance, and Phocion.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> I pity them from my soul: they were ignorant
of the truth: they are lost, my cousin! take my word for it, they
are lost men.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Unhappily, they are. I wish we had them back
again; or that, since we have lost them, we could at least find
among us the virtues they left for our example.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Alas, my poor cousin! you too are blind; you do
not understand the plainest words, nor comprehend those
verities which are the most evident and palpable. Virtues!
if the poor wretches had any, they were false ones.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Scarcely ever has there been a politician, in any free
state, without much falsehood and duplicity. I have named the
most illustrious exceptions. Slender and irregular lines of a
darker colour run along the bright blade that decides the fate
of nations, and may indeed be necessary to the perfection of
its temper. The great warrior has usually his darker lines of
character, necessary (it may be) to constitute his greatness. No
two men possess the same quantity of the same virtues, if they
have many or much. We want some which do not far outstep
us, and which we may follow with the hope of reaching; we
want others to elevate, and others to defend us. The order
of things would be less beautiful without this variety. Without
the ebb and flow of our passions, but guided and moderated by
a beneficent light above, the ocean of life would stagnate; and
zeal, devotion, eloquence, would become dead carcasses, collapsing
and wasting on unprofitable sands. The vices of some men
cause the virtues of others, as corruption is the parent of fertility.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> O my cousin! this doctrine is diabolical.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> What is it?</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Diabolical; a strong expression in daily use among
us. We turn it a little from its origin.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Timotheus, I love to sit by the side of a clear water,
although there is nothing in it but naked stones. Do not take
the trouble to muddy the stream of language for my benefit;
I am not about to fish in it.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Well, we will speak about things which come nearer
to your apprehension. I only wish you were somewhat less
indifferent in your choice between the true and the false.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> We take it for granted that what is not true must
be false.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Surely we do.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> This is erroneous.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Are you grown captious? Pray explain.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> What is not true, I need not say, must be untrue;
but that alone is false which is intended to deceive. A witness
may be mistaken, yet would not you call him a false witness
unless he asserted what he knew to be false.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Quibbles upon words!</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> On words, on quibbles, if you please to call distinctions
so, rests the axis of the intellectual world. A winged word hath
stuck ineradicably in a million hearts, and envenomed every
hour throughout their hard pulsation. On a winged word hath
hung the destiny of nations. On a winged word hath human
wisdom been willing to cast the immortal soul, and to leave it
dependent for all its future happiness. It is because a word is
unsusceptible of explanation, or because they who employed
it were impatient of any, that enormous evils have prevailed,
not only against our common sense, but against our common
humanity. Hence the most pernicious of absurdities, far
exceeding in folly and mischief the worship of threescore gods;
namely, that an implicit faith in what outrages our reason, which
we know is God&#8217;s gift, and bestowed on us for our guidance,
that this weak, blind, stupid faith is surer of His favour than the
constant practice of every human virtue. They at whose hands
one prodigious lie, such as this, hath been accepted, may reckon
on their influence in the dissemination of many smaller, and
may turn them easily to their own account. Be sure they will
do it sooner or later. The fly floats on the surface for a while,
but up springs the fish at last and swallows it.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Was ever man so unjust as you are? The
abominable old priesthoods are avaricious and luxurious: ours
is willing to stand or fall by maintaining its ordinances of fellowship
and frugality. Point out to me a priest of our religion whom
you could, by any temptation or entreaty, so far mislead, that
he shall reserve for his own consumption one loaf, one plate of
lentils, while another poor Christian hungers. In the meanwhile
the priests of Isis are proud and wealthy, and admit none
of the indigent to their tables. And now, to tell you the whole
truth, my Cousin Lucian, I come to you this morning to propose
that we should lay our heads together and compose a merry
dialogue on these said priests of Isis. What say you?</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> These said priests of Isis have already been with me,
several times, on a similar business in regard to yours.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Malicious wretches!</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Beside, they have attempted to persuade me that
your religion is borrowed from theirs, altering a name a little
and laying the scene of action in a corner, in the midst of
obscurity and ruins.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> The wicked dogs! the hellish liars! We have
nothing in common with such vile impostors. Are they not
ashamed of taking such unfair means of lowering us in the
estimation of our fellow-citizens? And so, they artfully came
to you, craving any spare jibe to throw against us! They lie
open to these weapons; we do not: we stand above the malignity,
above the strength, of man. You would do justly in turning
their own devices against them: it would be amusing to see how
they would look. If you refuse me, I am resolved to write a
Dialogue of the Dead, myself, and to introduce these hypocrites
in it.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Consider well first, my good Timotheus, whether you
can do any such thing with propriety; I mean to say judiciously
in regard to composition.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> I always thought you generous and open-hearted,
and quite inaccessible to jealousy.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Let nobody ever profess himself so much as that:
for, although he may be insensible of the disease, it lurks within
him, and only waits its season to break out. But really, my
cousin, at present I feel no symptoms: and, to prove that I
am ingenuous and sincere with you, these are my reasons for
dissuasion. We believers in the Homeric family of gods and
goddesses, believe also in the locality of Tartarus and Elysium.
We entertain no doubt whatever that the passions of men and
demigods and gods are nearly the same above ground and below;
and that Achilles would dispatch his spear through the body
of any shade who would lead Briseis too far among the myrtles,
or attempt to throw the halter over the ears of any chariot
horse belonging to him in the meads of asphodel. We admit
no doubt of these verities, delivered down to us from the ages
when Theseus and Hercules had descended into Hades itself.
Instead of a few stadions in a cavern, with a bank and a bower
at the end of it, under a very small portion of our diminutive
Hellas, you Christians possess the whole cavity of the earth for
punishment, and the whole convex of the sky for felicity.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Our passions are burnt out amid the fires of
purification, and our intellects are elevated to the enjoyment of
perfect intelligence.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> How silly then and incongruous would it be, not to
say how impious, to represent your people as no better and no
wiser than they were before, and discoursing on subjects which
no longer can or ought to concern them. Christians must
think your Dialogue of the Dead no less irreligious than their
opponents think mine, and infinitely more absurd. If indeed
you are resolved on this form of composition, there is no topic
which may not, with equal facility, be discussed on earth; and
you may intersperse as much ridicule as you please, without
any fear of censure for inconsistency or irreverence. Hitherto
such writers have confined their view mostly to speculative
points, sophistic reasonings, and sarcastic interpellations.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Ha! you are always fond of throwing a little pebble
at the lofty Plato, whom we, on the contrary, are ready to
receive (in a manner) as one of ourselves.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> To throw pebbles is a very uncertain way of showing
where lie defects. Whenever I have mentioned him seriously,
I have brought forward, not accusations, but passages from his
writings, such as no philosopher or scholar or moralist can
defend.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> His doctrines are too abstruse and too sublime
for you.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Solon, Anaxagoras, and Epicurus, are more sublime,
if truth is sublimity.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Truth is, indeed; for God is truth.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> We are upon earth to learn what can be learnt upon
earth, and not to speculate on what never can be. This you,
O Timotheus, may call philosophy: to me it appears the idlest
of curiosity; for every other kind may teach us something, and
may lead to more beyond. Let men learn what benefits men;
above all things, to contract their wishes, to calm their passions,
and, more especially, to dispel their fears. Now these are to
be dispelled, not by collecting clouds, but by piercing and
scattering them. In the dark we may imagine depths and
heights immeasurable, which, if a torch be carried right before
us, we find it easy to leap across. Much of what we call sublime
is only the residue of infancy, and the worst of it.</p>

<p>The philosophers I quoted are too capacious for schools and
systems. Without noise, without ostentation, without mystery,
not quarrelsome, not captious, not frivolous, their lives were
commentaries on their doctrine. Never evaporating into mist,
never stagnating into mire, their limpid and broad morality
runs parallel with the lofty summits of their genius.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Genius! was ever genius like Plato&#8217;s?</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> The most admired of his Dialogues, his <i>Banquet</i>,
is beset with such puerilities, deformed with such pedantry,
and disgraced with such impurity, that none but the thickest
beards, and chiefly of the philosophers and the satyrs, should
bend over it. On a former occasion he has given us a specimen
of history, than which nothing in our language is worse: here
he gives us one of poetry, in honour of Love, for which the god
has taken ample vengeance on him, by perverting his taste and
feelings. The grossest of all the absurdities in this dialogue is,
attributing to Aristophanes, so much of a scoffer and so little
of a visionary, the silly notion of male and female having been
originally complete in one person, and walking circuitously.
He may be joking: who knows?</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Forbear! forbear! do not call this notion a silly
one: he took it from our Holy Scriptures, but perverted it somewhat.
Woman was made from man&#8217;s rib, and did not require
to be cut asunder all the way down: this is no proof of bad reasoning,
but merely of misinterpretation.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> If you would rather have bad reasoning, I will adduce
a little of it. Farther on, he wishes to extol the wisdom of
Agathon by attributing to him such a sentence as this:</p>

<p>&#8216;It is evident that Love is the most beautiful of the gods,
<i>because</i> he is the youngest of them.&#8217;</p>

<p>Now, even on earth, the youngest is not always the most
beautiful; how infinitely less cogent, then, is the argument
when we come to speak of the Immortals, with whom age can
have no concern! There was a time when Vulcan was the
youngest of the gods: was he, also, at that time, and for that
reason, the most beautiful? Your philosopher tells us, moreover,
that &#8216;Love is of all deities the most <i>liquid</i>; else he never
could fold himself about everything, and flow into and out of
men&#8217;s souls.&#8217;</p>

<p>The three last sentences of Agathon&#8217;s rhapsody are very
harmonious, and exhibit the finest specimen of Plato&#8217;s style;
but we, accustomed as we are to hear him lauded for his poetical
diction, should hold that poem a very indifferent one which
left on the mind so superficial an impression. The garden of
Academus is flowery without fragrance, and dazzling without
warmth: I am ready to dream away an hour in it after dinner,
but I think it insalutary for a night&#8217;s repose. So satisfied was
Plato with his <i>Banquet</i>, that he says of himself, in the person
of Socrates, &#8216;How can I or any one but find it difficult to speak
after a discourse so eloquent? It would have been wonderful
if the brilliancy of the sentences at the end of it, and the choice
of expression throughout, had not astonished all the auditors.
I, who can never say anything nearly so beautiful, would if
possible have made my escape, and have fairly run off for shame.&#8217;
He had indeed much better run off before he made so wretched
a pun on the name of Gorgias. &#8216;I dreaded,&#8217; says he, &#8216;lest
Agathon, <i>measuring my discourse by the head of the eloquent
Gorgias, should turn me to stone</i> for inability of utterance.&#8217;</p>

<p>Was there ever joke more frigid? What painful twisting of
unelastic stuff! If Socrates was the wisest man in the world,
it would require another oracle to persuade us, after this, that
he was the wittiest. But surely a small share of common
sense would have made him abstain from hazarding such failures.
He falls on his face in very flat and very dry ground; and, when
he gets up again, his quibbles are well-nigh as tedious as his
witticisms. However, he has the presence of mind to throw
them on the shoulders of Diotima, whom he calls a prophetess,
and who, ten years before the plague broke out in Athens,
obtained from the gods (he tells us) that delay. Ah! the gods
were doubly mischievous: they sent her first. Read her words,
my cousin, as delivered by Socrates; and if they have another
plague in store for us, you may avert it by such an act of
expiation.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> The world will have ended before ten years are
over.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> It has been pronounced.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> How the threads of belief and unbelief run woven
close together in the whole web of human life! Come, come;
take courage; you will have time for your Dialogue. Enlarge
the circle; enrich it with a variety of matter, enliven it with a
multitude of characters, occupy the intellect of the thoughtful,
the imagination of the lively; spread the board with solid viands,
delicate rarities, and sparkling wines; and throw, along the
whole extent of it, geniality and festal crowns.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> What writer of dialogues hath ever done this, or
undertaken, or conceived, or hoped it?</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> None whatever; yet surely you yourself may, when
even your babes and sucklings are endowed with abilities incomparably
greater than our niggardly old gods have bestowed
on the very best of us.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> I wish, my dear Lucian, you would let our babes
and sucklings lie quiet, and say no more about them: as for
your gods, I leave them at your mercy. Do not impose on me
the performance of a task in which Plato himself, if he had
attempted it, would have failed.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> No man ever detected false reasoning with more
quickness; but unluckily he called in Wit at the exposure;
and Wit, I am sorry to say, held the lowest place in his household.
He sadly mistook the qualities of his mind in attempting
the facetious; or, rather, he fancied he possessed one quality
more than belonged to him. But, if he himself had not been a
worse quibbler than any whose writings are come down to us,
we might have been gratified by the exposure of wonderful
acuteness wretchedly applied. It is no small service to the
community to turn into ridicule the grave impostors, who are
contending which of them shall guide and govern us, whether
in politics or religion. There are always a few who will take the
trouble to walk down among the seaweeds and slippery stones,
for the sake of showing their credulous fellow-citizens that
skins filled with sand, and set upright at the forecastle, are
neither men nor merchandise.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> I can bring to mind, O Lucian, no writer possessing
so great a variety of wit as you.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> No man ever possessed any variety of this gift; and
the holder is not allowed to exchange the quality for another.
Banter (and such is Plato&#8217;s) never grows large, never sheds its
bristles, and never do they soften into the humorous or the
facetious.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> I agree with you that banter is the worst species
of wit. We have indeed no correct idea what persons those
really were whom Plato drags by the ears, to undergo slow
torture under Socrates. One sophist, I must allow, is precisely
like another: no discrimination of character, none of manner,
none of language.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> He wanted the fancy and fertility of Aristophanes.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Otherwise, his mind was more elevated and more
poetical.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Pardon me if I venture to express my dissent in both
particulars. Knowledge of the human heart, and discrimination
of character, are requisites of the poet. Few ever have
possessed them in an equal degree with Aristophanes: Plato
has given no indication of either.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> But consider his imagination.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> On what does it rest? He is nowhere so imaginative
as in his <i>Polity</i>. Nor is there any state in the world that is, or
would be, governed by it. One day you may find him at his
counter in the midst of old-fashioned toys, which crack and
crumble under his fingers while he exhibits and recommends
them; another day, while he is sitting on a goat&#8217;s bladder, I
may discover his bald head surmounting an enormous mass
of loose chaff and uncleanly feathers, which he would persuade
you is the pleasantest and healthiest of beds, and that dreams
descend on it from the gods.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Open your mouth, and shut your eyes, and see what Zeus shall send you,&#8217;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p>says Aristophanes in his favourite metre. In this helpless
condition of closed optics and hanging jaw, we find the followers
of Plato. It is by shutting their eyes that they see, and
by opening their mouths that they apprehend. Like certain
broad-muzzled dogs, all stand equally stiff and staunch, although
few scent the game, and their lips wag, and water, at whatever
distance from the net. We must leave them with their hands
hanging down before them, confident that they are wiser than
we are, were it only for this attitude of humility. It is amusing
to see them in it before the tall, well-robed Athenian, while he
mis-spells the charms, and plays clumsily the tricks, he acquired
from the conjurors here in Egypt. I wish you better success
with the same materials. But in my opinion all philosophers
should speak clearly. The highest things are the purest and
brightest; and the best writers are those who render them the
most intelligible to the world below. In the arts and sciences,
and particularly in music and metaphysics, this is difficult:
but the subjects not being such as lie within the range of the
community, I lay little stress upon them, and wish authors to
deal with them as they best may, only beseeching that they
recompense us, by bringing within our comprehension the other
things with which they are entrusted for us. The followers of
Plato fly off indignantly from any such proposal. If I ask
them the meaning of some obscure passage, they answer that
I am unprepared and unfitted for it, and that his mind is so
far above mine, I cannot grasp it. I look up into the faces of
these worthy men, who mingle so much commiseration with so
much calmness, and wonder at seeing them look no less vacant
than my own.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> You have acknowledged his eloquence, while you
derided his philosophy and repudiated his morals.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Certainly there was never so much eloquence with
so little animation. When he has heated his oven, he forgets
to put the bread into it; instead of which, he throws in another
bundle of faggots. His words and sentences are often too large
for the place they occupy. If a water-melon is not to be placed
in an oyster-shell, neither is a grain of millet in a golden salver.
At high festivals a full band may enter: ordinary conversation
goes on better without it.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> There is something so spiritual about him, that
many of us Christians are firmly of opinion he must have been
partially enlightened from above.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I hope and believe we all are. His entire works are
in our library. Do me the favour to point out to me a few of
those passages where in poetry he approaches the spirit of
Aristophanes, or where in morals he comes up to Epictetus.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> It is useless to attempt it if you carry your
prejudices with you. Beside, my dear cousin, I would not offend
you, but really your mind has no point about it which could be
brought to contact or affinity with Plato&#8217;s.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> In the universality of his genius there must surely
be some atom coincident with another in mine. You acknowledge,
as everybody must do, that his wit is the heaviest and
lowest: pray, is the specimen he has given us of history at all
better?</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> I would rather look to the loftiness of his mind,
and the genius that sustains him.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> So would I. Magnificent words, and the pomp
and procession of stately sentences, may accompany genius,
but are not always nor frequently called out by it. The voice
ought not to be perpetually nor much elevated in the ethic
and didactic, nor to roll sonorously, as if it issued from a mask
in the theatre. The horses in the plain under Troy are not
always kicking and neighing; nor is the dust always raised in
whirlwinds on the banks of Simois and Scamander; nor are the
rampires always in a blaze. Hector has lowered his helmet to
the infant of Andromache, and Achilles to the embraces of
Briseis. I do not blame the prose-writer who opens his bosom
occasionally to a breath of poetry; neither, on the contrary, can
I praise the gait of that pedestrian who lifts up his legs as high
on a bare heath as in a cornfield. Be authority as old and
obstinate as it may, never let it persuade you that a man is
the stronger for being unable to keep himself on the ground,
or the weaker for breathing quietly and softly on ordinary
occasions. Tell me, over and over, that you find every great
quality in Plato: let me only once ask you in return, whether he
ever is ardent and energetic, whether he wins the affections,
whether he agitates the heart. Finding him deficient in every
one of these faculties, I think his disciples have extolled him too
highly. Where power is absent, we may find the robes of genius,
but we miss the throne. He would acquit a slave who killed
another in self-defence, but if he killed any free man, even in
self-defence; he was not only to be punished with death, but to
undergo the cruel death of a parricide. This effeminate philosopher
was more severe than the manly Demosthenes, who
quotes a law against the striking of a slave: and Diogenes,
when one ran away from him, remarked that it would be horrible
if Diogenes could not do without a slave, when a slave could do
without Diogenes.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Surely the allegories of Plato are evidences of
his genius.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> A great poet in the hours of his idleness may indulge
in allegory: but the highest poetical character will never rest on
so unsubstantial a foundation. The poet must take man from
God&#8217;s hands, must look into every fibre of his heart and brain,
must be able to take the magnificent work to pieces, and to
reconstruct it. When this labour is completed, let him throw
himself composedly on the earth, and care little how many of its
ephemeral insects creep over him. In regard to these allegories
of Plato, about which I have heard so much, pray what and
where are they? You hesitate, my fair cousin Timotheus!
Employ one morning in transcribing them, and another in noting
all the passages which are of practical utility in the commerce
of social life, or purify our affections at home, or excite and
elevate our enthusiasm in the prosperity and glory of our
country. Useful books, moral books, instructive books are
easily composed: and surely so great a writer should present
them to us without blot or blemish: I find among his many
volumes no copy of a similar composition. My enthusiasm is
not easily raised indeed; yet such a whirlwind of a poet must
carry it away with him; nevertheless, here I stand, calm and
collected, not a hair of my beard in commotion. Declamation
will find its echo in vacant places: it beats ineffectually on the
well-furnished mind. Give me proof; bring the work; show the
passages; convince, confound, overwhelm me.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> I may do that another time with Plato. And yet,
what effect can I hope to produce on an unhappy man who
doubts even that the world is on the point of extinction?</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Are there many of your association who believe that
this catastrophe is so near at hand?</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> We all believe it; or rather, we all are certain of it.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> How so? Have you observed any fracture in the
disk of the sun? Are any of the stars loosened in their orbits?
Has the beautiful light of Venus ceased to pant in the heavens,
or has the belt of Orion lost its gems?</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Oh, for shame!</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Rather should I be ashamed of indifference on so
important an occasion.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> We know the fact by surer signs.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> These, if you could vouch for them, would be sure
enough for me. The least of them would make me sweat as
profusely as if I stood up to the neck in the hot preparation of
a mummy. Surely no wise or benevolent philosopher could
ever have uttered what he knew or believed might be distorted
into any such interpretation. For if men are persuaded that
they and their works are so soon about to perish, what
provident care are they likely to take in the education and
welfare of their families? What sciences will they improve,
what learning will they cultivate, what monuments of past
ages will they be studious to preserve, who are certain that there
can be no future ones? Poetry will be censured as rank profaneness,
eloquence will be converted into howls and execrations,
statuary will exhibit only Midases and Ixions, and all the
colours of painting will be mixed together to produce one grand
conflagration: <i>flammantia moenia mundi</i>.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Do not quote an atheist; especially in Latin.
I hate the language; the Romans are beginning to differ from
us already.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Ah! you will soon split into smaller fractions. But
pardon me my unusual fault of quoting. Before I let fall a
quotation I must be taken by surprise. I seldom do it in conversation,
seldomer in composition; for it mars the beauty and
unity of style, especially when it invades it from a foreign
tongue. A quoter is either ostentatious of his acquirements or
doubtful of his cause. And moreover, he never walks gracefully
who leans upon the shoulder of another, however gracefully
that other may walk. Herodotus, Plato, Aristoteles, Demosthenes,
are no quoters. Thucydides, twice or thrice, inserts a
few sentences of Pericles: but Thucydides is an emanation of
Pericles, somewhat less clear indeed, being lower, although at
no great distance from that purest and most pellucid source.
The best of the Romans, I agree with you, are remote from such
originals, if not in power of mind, or in acuteness of remark, or
in sobriety of judgment, yet in the graces of composition.
While I admired, with a species of awe such as not Homer
himself ever impressed me with, the majesty and sanctimony of
Livy, I have been informed by learned Romans that in the
structure of his sentences he is often inharmonious, and
sometimes uncouth. I can imagine such uncouthness in the
goddess of battles, confident of power and victory, when part of
her hair is waving round the helmet, loosened by the rapidity of
her descent or the vibration of her spear. Composition may be
too adorned even for beauty. In painting it is often requisite to
cover a bright colour with one less bright; and, in language, to
relieve the ear from the tension of high notes, even at the
cost of a discord. There are urns of which the borders are
too prominent and too decorated for use, and which appear to
be brought out chiefly for state, at grand carousals. The
author who imitates the artificers of these, shall never have my
custom.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> I think you judge rightly: but I do not understand
languages: I only understand religion.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> He must be a most accomplished, a most extraordinary
man, who comprehends them both together. We do
not even talk clearly when we are walking in the dark.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Thou art not merely walking in the dark, but fast
asleep.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> And thou, my cousin, wouldst kindly awaken me with
a red-hot poker. I have but a few paces to go along the corridor
of life: prithee let me turn into my bed again and lie quiet.
Never was any man less an enemy to religion than I am, whatever
may be said to the contrary: and you shall judge of me by
the soundness of my advice. If your leaders are in earnest, as
many think, do persuade them to abstain from quarrelsomeness
and contention, and not to declare it necessary that there should
perpetually be a religious as well as a political war between
east and west. No honest and considerate man will believe in
their doctrines, who, inculcating peace and good-will, continue
all the time to assail their fellow-citizens with the utmost
rancour at every divergency of opinion, and, forbidding the
indulgence of the kindlier affections, exercise at full stretch the
fiercer. This is certain: if they obey any commander, they will
never sound a charge when his order is to sound a retreat: if
they acknowledge any magistrate, they will never tear down the
tablet of his edicts.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> We have what is all-sufficient.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I see you have.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> You have ridiculed all religion and all philosophy.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I have found but little of either. I have cracked
many a nut, and have come only to dust or maggots.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> To say nothing of the saints, are all philosophers
fools or impostors? And, because you cannot rise to the
ethereal heights of Plato, nor comprehend the real magnitude
of a man so much above you, must he be a dwarf?</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> The best sight is not that which sees best in the dark
or the twilight; for no objects are then visible in their true
colours, and just proportions; but it is that which presents to
us things as they are, and indicates what is within our reach
and what is beyond it. Never were any three writers, of high
celebrity, so little understood in the main character, as Plato,
Diogenes, and Epicurus. Plato is a perfect master of logic and
rhetoric; and whenever he errs in either, as I have proved to you
he does occasionally, he errs through perverseness, not through
unwariness. His language often settles into clear and most
beautiful prose, often takes an imperfect and incoherent shape
of poetry, and often, cloud against cloud, bursts with a vehement
detonation in the air. Diogenes was hated both by the vulgar
and the philosophers. By the philosophers, because he exposed
their ignorance, ridiculed their jealousies, and rebuked their
pride: by the vulgar, because they never can endure a man
apparently of their own class who avoids their society and partakes
in none of their humours, prejudices, and animosities.
What right has he to be greater or better than they are? he who
wears older clothes, who eats staler fish, and possesses no vote
to imprison or banish anybody. I am now ashamed that I
mingled in the rabble, and that I could not resist the childish
mischief of smoking him in his tub. He was the wisest man of
his time, not excepting Aristoteles; for he knew that he was
greater than Philip or Alexander. Aristoteles did not know
that he himself was, or knowing it, did not act up to his knowledge;
and here is a deficiency of wisdom.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Whether you did or did not strike the cask,
Diogenes would have closed his eyes equally. He would never
have come forth and seen the truth, had it shone upon the world
in that day. But, intractable as was this recluse, Epicurus,
I fear, is quite as lamentable. What horrible doctrines!</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Enjoy, said he, the pleasant walks where you are:
repose and eat gratefully the fruit that falls into your bosom:
do not weary your feet with an excursion, at the end whereof
you will find no resting-place: reject not the odour of roses for
the fumes of pitch and sulphur. What horrible doctrines!</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Speak seriously. He was much too bad for
ridicule.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I will then speak as you desire me, seriously. His
smile was so unaffected and so graceful, that I should have
thought it very injudicious to set my laugh against it. No
philosopher ever lived with such uniform purity, such abstinence
from censoriousness, from controversy, from jealousy, and
from arrogance.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Ah, poor mortal! I pity him, as far as may be;
he is in hell: it would be wicked to wish him out: we are not to
murmur against the all-wise dispensations.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I am sure he would not; and it is therefore I hope he
is more comfortable than you believe.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Never have I defiled my fingers, and never will
I defile them, by turning over his writings. But in regard to
Plato, I can have no objection to take your advice.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> He will reward your assiduity: but he will assist you
very little if you consult him principally (and eloquence for this
should principally be consulted) to strengthen your humanity.
Grandiloquent and sonorous, his lungs seem to play the better
for the absence of the heart. His imagination is the most
conspicuous, buoyed up by swelling billows over unsounded
depths. There are his mild thunders, there are his glowing
clouds, his traversing coruscations, and his shooting stars.
More of true wisdom, more of trustworthy manliness, more of
promptitude and power to keep you steady and straightforward
on the perilous road of life, may be found in the little manual
of Epictetus, which I could write in the palm of my left
hand, than there is in all the rolling and redundant volumes
of this mighty rhetorician, which you may begin to transcribe
on the summit of the Great Pyramid, carry down over the
Sphinx at the bottom, and continue on the sands half-way to
Memphis. And indeed the materials are appropriate; one part
being far above our sight, and the other on what, by the most
befitting epithet, Homer calls the <i>no-corn-bearing</i>.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> There are many who will stand against you on
this ground.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> With what perfect ease and fluency do some of the
dullest men in existence toss over and discuss the most elaborate
of all works! How many myriads of such creatures would be
insufficient to furnish intellect enough for any single paragraph
in them! Yet &#8216;<i>we think this</i>&#8217;, &#8216;<i>we advise that</i>&#8217;, are expressions
now become so customary, that it would be difficult to turn
them into ridicule. We must pull the creatures out while they
are in the very act, and show who and what they are. One of
these fellows said to Caius Fuscus in my hearing, that there was
a time when it was permitted him to doubt occasionally on
particular points of criticism, but that the time was now over.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> And what did you think of such arrogance?
What did you reply to such impertinence?</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Let me answer one question at a time. First: I
thought him a legitimate fool, of the purest breed. Secondly:
I promised him I would always be contented with the judgment
he had rejected, leaving him and his friends in the enjoyment
of the rest.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> And what said he?</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I forget. He seemed pleased at my acknowledgment
of his discrimination, at my deference and delicacy. He
wished, however, I had studied Plato, Xenophon, and Cicero,
more attentively; without which preparatory discipline, no two
persons could be introduced advantageously into a dialogue.
I agreed with him on this position, remarking that we ourselves
were at that very time giving our sentence on the fact. He
suggested a slight mistake on my side, and expressed a wish
that he were conversing with a writer able to sustain the opposite
part. With his experience and skill in rhetoric, his long habitude
of composition, his knowledge of life, of morals, and of
character, he should be less verbose than Cicero, less gorgeous
than Plato, and less trimly attired than Xenophon.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> If he spoke in that manner, he might indeed be
ridiculed for conceitedness and presumption, but his language
is not altogether a fool&#8217;s.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I deliver his sentiments, not his words: for who
would read, or who would listen to me, if such fell from me
as from him? Poetry has its probabilities, so has prose: when
people cry out against the representation of a dullard, <i>Could he
have spoken all that?</i> &#8216;Certainly no,&#8217; is the reply: neither did
Priam implore, in harmonious verse, the pity of Achilles. We
say only what might be said, when great postulates are conceded.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> We will pretermit these absurd and silly men:
but, Cousin Lucian! Cousin Lucian! the name of Plato will be
durable as that of Sesostris.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> So will the pebbles and bricks which gangs of slaves
erected into a pyramid. I do not hold Sesostris in much higher
estimation than those quieter lumps of matter. They, O Timotheus,
who survive the wreck of ages, are by no means, as a body,
the worthiest of our admiration. It is in these wrecks, as in those
at sea, the best things are not always saved. Hen-coops and
empty barrels bob upon the surface, under a serene and smiling
sky, when the graven or depicted images of the gods are scattered
on invisible rocks, and when those who most resemble them in
knowledge and beneficence are devoured by cold monsters below.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> You now talk reasonably, seriously, almost
religiously. Do you ever pray?</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I do. It was no longer than five years ago that I was
deprived by death of my dog Melanops. He had uniformly led
an innocent life; for I never would let him walk out with me,
lest he should bring home in his mouth the remnant of some god
or other, and at last get bitten or stung by one. I reminded
Anubis of this: and moreover I told him, what he ought to be
aware of, that Melanops did honour to his relationship.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> I cannot ever call it piety to pray for dumb and
dead beasts.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Timotheus! Timotheus! have you no heart? have
you no dog? do you always pray only for yourself?</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> We do not believe that dogs can live again.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> More shame for you! If they enjoy and suffer,
if they hope and fear, if calamities and wrongs befall them, such
as agitate their hearts and excite their apprehensions; if they
possess the option of being grateful or malicious, and choose
the worthier; if they exercise the same sound judgment on many
other occasions, some for their own benefit and some for the
benefit of their masters, they have as good a chance of a future
life, and a better chance of a happy one, than half the priests
of all the religions in the world. Wherever there is the choice
of doing well or ill, and that choice (often against a first impulse)
decides for well, there must not only be a soul of the same nature
as man&#8217;s, although of less compass and comprehension, but,
being of the same nature, the same immortality must appertain
to it; for spirit, like body, may change, but cannot be annihilated.</p>

<p>It was among the prejudices of former times that pigs are
uncleanly animals, and fond of wallowing in the mire for mire&#8217;s
sake. Philosophy has now discovered that when they roll in
mud and ordure, it is only from an excessive love of cleanliness,
and a vehement desire to rid themselves of scabs and vermin.
Unfortunately, doubts keep pace with discoveries. They are
like warts, of which the blood that springs from a great one
extirpated, makes twenty little ones.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> The Hydra would be a more noble simile.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I was indeed about to illustrate my position by the
old Hydra, so ready at hand and so tractable; but I will never
take hold of a hydra, when a wart will serve my turn.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Continue then.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Even children are now taught, in despite of Aesop,
that animals never spoke. The uttermost that can be advanced
with any show of confidence is, that if they spoke at all, they
spoke in unknown tongues. Supposing the fact, is this a reason
why they should not be respected? Quite the contrary. If
the tongues were unknown, it tends to demonstrate <i>our</i> ignorance,
not <i>theirs</i>. If we could not understand them, while they
possessed the gift, here is no proof that they did not speak to
the purpose, but only that it was not to <i>our</i> purpose; which may
likewise be said with equal certainty of the wisest men that ever
existed. How little have we learned from them, for the conduct
of life or the avoidance of calamity! Unknown tongues, indeed!
yes, so are all tongues to the vulgar and the negligent.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> It comforts me to hear you talk in this manner,
without a glance at our gifts and privileges.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I am less incredulous than you suppose, my cousin!
Indeed I have been giving you what ought to be a sufficient
proof of it.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> You have spoken with becoming gravity, I must
confess.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Let me then submit to your judgment some fragments
of history which have lately fallen into my hands. There is
among them a <i>hymn</i>, of which the metre is so incondite, and the
phraseology so ancient, that the grammarians have attributed
it to Linus. But the hymn will interest you less, and is less to
our purpose, than the tradition; by which it appears that certain
priests of high antiquity were of the brute creation.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> No better, any of them.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Now you have polished the palms of your hands,
I will commence my narrative from the manuscript.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Pray do.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> There existed in the city of Nephosis a fraternity of
priests, reverenced by the appellation of <i>Gasteres</i>. It is reported
that they were not always of their present form, but were
birds aquatic and migratory, a species of cormorant. The poet
Linus, who lived nearer the transformation (if there indeed
was any), sings thus, in his Hymn to Zeus:</p>

<p>&#8216;Thy power is manifest, O Zeus! in the Gasteres. Wild birds
were they, strong of talon, clanging of wing, and clamorous of
gullet. Wild birds, O Zeus! wild birds; now cropping the tender
grass by the river of Adonis, and breaking the nascent reed at
the root, and depasturing the sweet nymphaea; now again
picking up serpents and other creeping things on each hand of
old Aegyptos, whose head is hidden in the clouds.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh that Mnemosyne would command the staidest of her
three daughters to stand and sing before me! to sing clearly and
strongly. How before thy throne, Saturnian! sharp voices
arose, even the voices of Her&eacute; and of thy children. How they
cried out that innumerable mortal men, various-tongued, kid-roasters
in tent and tabernacle, devising in their many-turning
hearts and thoughtful minds how to fabricate well-rounded spits
of beech-tree, how such men having been changed into brute
animals, it behoved thee to trim the balance, and in thy wisdom
to change sundry brute animals into men; in order that they
might pour out flame-coloured wine unto thee, and sprinkle the
white flower of the sea upon the thighs of many bulls, to pleasure
thee. Then didst thou, O storm-driver! overshadow far lands
with thy dark eyebrows, looking down on them, to accomplish
thy will. And then didst thou behold the Gasteres, fat, tall,
prominent-crested, purple-legged, daedal-plumed, white and
black, changeable in colour as Iris. And lo! thou didst will it,
and they were men.&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> No doubt whatever can be entertained of this
hymn&#8217;s antiquity. But what farther says the historian?</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I will read on, to gratify you.</p>

<p>&#8216;It is recorded that this ancient order of a most lordly priesthood
went through many changes of customs and ceremonies,
which indeed they were always ready to accommodate to the
maintenance of their authority and the enjoyment of their
riches. It is recorded that, in the beginning, they kept various
tame animals, and some wild ones, within the precincts of the
temple: nevertheless, after a time, they applied to their own
uses everything they could lay their hands on, whatever might
have been the vow of those who came forward with the offering.
And when it was expected of them to make sacrifices, they not
only would make none, but declared it an act of impiety to
expect it. Some of the people, who feared the Immortals, were
dismayed and indignant at this backwardness; and the discontent
at last grew universal. Whereupon, the two chief
priests held a long conference together, and agreed that something
must be done to pacify the multitude. But it was not
until the greater of them, acknowledging his despondency, called
on the gods to answer for him that his grief was only because
he never could abide bad precedents: and the other, on his side,
protested that he was overruled by his superior, and moreover
had a serious objection (founded on principle) to be knocked on
the head. Meanwhile the elder was looking down on the folds
of his robe, in deep melancholy. After long consideration, he
sprang upon his feet, pushing his chair behind him, and said,
&ldquo;Well, it is grown old, and was always too long for me: I am
resolved to cut off a finger&#8217;s breadth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#8216;&ldquo;Having, in your wisdom and piety, well contemplated the
bad precedent,&rdquo; said the other, with much consternation in his
countenance at seeing so elastic a spring in a heel by no means
bearing any resemblance to a stag&#8217;s.... &ldquo;I have, I have,&rdquo;
replied the other, interrupting him; &ldquo;say no more; I am sick at
heart; you must do the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#8216;&ldquo;A cursed dog has torn a hole in mine,&rdquo; answered the other,
&ldquo;and, if I cut anywhere about it, I only make bad worse. In
regard to its length, I wish it were as long again.&rdquo; &ldquo;Brother!
brother! never be worldly-minded,&rdquo; said the senior. &ldquo;Follow
my example: snip off it not a finger&#8217;s breadth, half a finger&#8217;s
breadth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#8216;&ldquo;But,&rdquo; expostulated the other, &ldquo;will that satisfy the gods?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Who talked about them?&rdquo; placidly said the senior. &ldquo;It is
very unbecoming to have them always in our mouths: surely
there are appointed times for them. Let us be contented with
laying the snippings on the altar, and thus showing the people
our piety and condescension. They, and the gods also, will be
just as well satisfied, as if we offered up a buttock of beef, with
a bushel of salt and the same quantity of wheaten flour on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#8216;&ldquo;Well, if that will do ... and you know best,&rdquo; replied the
other, &ldquo;so be it.&rdquo; Saying which words, he carefully and considerately
snipped off as much in proportion (for he was shorter
by an inch) as the elder had done, yet leaving on his shoulders
quite enough of materials to make handsome cloaks for seven
or eight stout-built generals. Away they both went, arm-in-arm,
and then holding up their skirts a great deal higher than
was necessary, told the gods what they two had been doing for
them and their glory. About the court of the temple the sacred
swine were lying in indolent composure: seeing which, the
brotherly twain began to commune with themselves afresh:
and the senior said repentantly, &ldquo;What fools we have been!
The populace will laugh outright at the curtailment of our
vestures, but would gladly have seen these animals eat daily a
quarter less of the lentils.&rdquo; The words were spoken so earnestly
and emphatically that they were overheard by the quadrupeds.
Suddenly there was a rising of all the principal ones in the sacred
enclosure: and many that were in the streets took up, each
according to his temperament and condition, the gravest or
shrillest tone of reprobation. The thinner and therefore the
more desperate of the creatures, pushing their snouts under the
curtailed habiliments of the high priests, assailed them with
ridicule and reproach. For it had pleased the gods to work a
miracle in their behoof, and they became as loquacious as those
who governed them, and who were appointed to speak in the
high places. &ldquo;Let the worst come to the worst, we at least
have our tails to our hams,&rdquo; said they. &ldquo;For how long?&rdquo;
whined others, piteously: others incessantly ejaculated tremendous
imprecations: others, more serious and sedate, groaned
inwardly; and, although under their hearts there lay a huge
mass of indigestible sourness ready to rise up against the chief
priests, they ventured no farther than expostulation. &ldquo;We
shall lose our voices,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;if we lose our complement of
lentils; and then, most reverend lords, what will ye do for
choristers?&rdquo; Finally, one of grand dimensions, who seemed
almost half-human, imposed silence on every debater. He lay
stretched out apart from his brethren, covering with his side the
greater portion of a noble dunghill, and all its verdure native
and imported. He crushed a few measures of peascods to cool
his tusks; then turned his pleasurable longitudinal eyes far
toward the outer extremities of their sockets, and leered fixedly
and sarcastically at the high priests, showing every tooth in
each jaw. Other men might have feared them; the high priests
envied them, seeing what order they were in, and what exploits
they were capable of. A great painter, who flourished many
olympiads ago, has, in his volume entitled the <i>Canon</i>, defined
the line of beauty. It was here in its perfection: it followed
with winning obsequiousness every member, but delighted more
especially to swim along that placid and pliant curvature on
which Nature had ranged the implements of mastication.
Pawing with his cloven hoof, he suddenly changed his countenance
from the contemplative to the wrathful. At one effort
he rose up to his whole length, breadth, and height: and they
who had never seen him in earnest, nor separate from the
common swine of the enclosure, with which he was in the habit
of husking what was thrown to him, could form no idea what a
prodigious beast he was. Terrible were the expressions of
choler and comminations which burst forth from his fulminating
tusks. Erimanthus would have hidden his puny offspring
before them; and Hercules would have paused at the encounter.
Thrice he called aloud to the high priests: thrice he swore in
their own sacred language that they were a couple of thieves
and impostors: thrice he imprecated the worst maledictions
on his own head if they had not violated the holiest of their
vows, and were not ready even to sell their gods. A tremor
ran throughout the whole body of the united swine; so awful
was the adjuration! Even the Gasteres themselves in some sort
shuddered, not perhaps altogether at the solemn tone of its
impiety; for they had much experience in these matters. But
among them was a Gaster who was calmer than the swearer,
and more prudent and conciliating than those he swore against.
Hearing this objurgation, he went blandly up to the sacred
porker, and, lifting the flap of his right ear between forefinger
and thumb with all delicacy and gentleness, thus whispered
into it: &ldquo;You do not in your heart believe that any of us are
such fools as to sell our gods, at least while we have such a
reserve to fall back upon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#8216;&ldquo;Are we to be devoured?&rdquo; cried the noble porker, twitching
his ear indignantly from under the hand of the monitor. &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;
said he, laying it again, most soothingly, rather farther from
the tusks: &ldquo;hush! sweet friend! Devoured? Oh, certainly
not: that is to say, not <i>all</i>: or, if all, not all at once. Indeed
the holy men my brethren may perhaps be contented with
taking a little blood from each of you, entirely for the advantage
of your health and activity, and merely to compose a few
slender black-puddings for the inferior monsters of the temple,
who latterly are grown very exacting, and either are, or pretend
to be, hungry after they have eaten a whole handful of acorns,
swallowing I am ashamed to say what a quantity of water to
wash them down. We do not grudge them it, as they well
know: but they appear to have forgotten how recently no
inconsiderable portion of this bounty has been conferred. If
we, as they object to us, eat more, they ought to be aware that
it is by no means for our gratification, since we have abjured
it before the gods, but to maintain the dignity of the priesthood,
and to exhibit the beauty and utility of subordination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#8216;The noble porker had beaten time with his muscular tail
at many of these periods; but again his heart panted visibly,
and he could bear no more.</p>

<p>&#8216;&ldquo;All this for our good! for our activity! for our health!
Let us alone: we have health enough; we want no activity.
Let us alone, I say again, or by the Immortals!...&rdquo; &ldquo;Peace,
my son! Your breath is valuable: evidently you have but little
to spare: and what mortal knows how soon the gods may
demand the last of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#8216;At the beginning of this exhortation, the worthy high priest
had somewhat repressed the ebullient choler of his refractory
and pertinacious disciple, by applying his flat soft palm to the
signet-formed extremity of the snout.</p>

<p>&#8216;&ldquo;We are ready to hear complaints at all times,&rdquo; added he,
&ldquo;and to redress any grievance at our own. But beyond a doubt,
if you continue to raise your abominable outcries, some of the
people are likely to hit upon two discoveries: first that your
lentils would be sufficient to make daily for every poor family
a good wholesome porridge; and secondly, that your flesh,
properly cured, might hang up nicely against the forthcoming
bean-season.&rdquo; Pondering these mighty words, the noble porker
kept his eyes fixed upon him for some instants, then leaned
forward dejectedly, then tucked one foot under him, then
another, cautious to descend with dignity. At last he grunted
(it must for ever be ambiguous whether with despondency or
with resignation), pushed his wedgy snout far within the straw
subjacent, and sank into that repose which is granted to the
just.&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Cousin! there are glimmerings of truth and wisdom
in sundry parts of this discourse, not unlike little broken shells
entangled in dark masses of seaweed. But I would rather you
had continued to adduce fresh arguments to demonstrate the
beneficence of the Deity, proving (if you could) that our horses
and dogs, faithful servants and companions to us, and often
treated cruelly, may recognize us hereafter, and we them. We
have no authority for any such belief.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> We have authority for thinking and doing whatever
is humane. Speaking of humanity, it now occurs to me, I have
heard a report that some well-intentioned men of your religion
so interpret the words or wishes of its Founder, they would
abolish slavery throughout the empire.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Such deductions have been drawn indeed from
our Master&#8217;s doctrine: but the saner part of us receive it metaphorically,
and would only set men free from the bonds of sin.
For if domestic slaves were manumitted, we should neither have
a dinner dressed nor a bed made, unless by our own children:
and as to labour in the fields, who would cultivate them in this
hot climate? We must import slaves from Ethiopia and elsewhere,
wheresoever they can be procured: but the hardship
lies not on them; it lies on us, and bears heavily; for we must
first buy them with our money, and then feed them; and not
only must we maintain them while they are hale and hearty
and can serve us, but likewise in sickness and (unless we can
sell them for a trifle) in decrepitude. Do not imagine, my
cousin, that we are no better than enthusiasts, visionaries,
subverters of order, and ready to roll society down into one
flat surface.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I thought you were maligned: I said so.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> When the subject was discussed in our congregation,
the meaner part of the people were much in favour of the
abolition: but the chief priests and ministers absented themselves,
and gave no vote at all, deeming it secular, and saying
that in such matters the laws and customs of the country ought
to be observed.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Several of these chief priests and ministers are robed
in purple and fine linen, and fare sumptuously every day.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> I have hopes of you now.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Why so suddenly?</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Because you have repeated those blessed words,
which are only to be found in our Scriptures.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> There indeed I found them. But I also found in
the same volume words of the same speaker, declaring that the
rich shall never see His face in heaven.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> He does not always mean what you think He does.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> How is this? Did He then direct His discourses to
none but men more intelligent than I am?</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Unless He gave you understanding for the occasion,
they might mislead you.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Unquestionably. For instance, He tells us to
take no heed of to-morrow: He tells us to share equally all our
worldly goods: but we know that we cannot be respected unless
we bestow due care on our possessions, and that not only the
vulgar but the well-educated esteem us in proportion to the
gifts of fortune.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> The eclectic philosophy is most flourishing among
you Christians. You take whatever suits your appetites, and
reject the rest.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> We are not half so rich as the priests of Isis.
Give us their possessions; and we will not sit idle as they do,
but be able and ready to do incalculable good to our fellow-creatures.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I have never seen great possessions excite to great
alacrity. Usually they enfeeble the sympathies, and often
overlie and smother them.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Our religion is founded less on sympathies than
on miracles. Cousin! you smile most when you ought to be
most serious.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I was smiling at the thought of one whom I would
recommend to your especial notice, as soon as you disinherit
the priests of Isis. He may perhaps be refractory; for he
pretends (the knave!) to work miracles.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Impostor! who is he?</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Aulus of Pelusium. Idle and dissolute, he never
gained anything honestly but a scourging, if indeed he ever
made, what he long merited, this acquisition. Unable to run
into debt where he was known, he came over to Alexandria.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> I know him: I know him well. Here, of his own
accord, he has betaken himself to a new and regular life.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> He will presently wear it out, or make it sit easier
on his shoulders. My metaphor brings me to my story. Having
nothing to carry with him beside an empty valise, he resolved
on filling it with something, however worthless, lest, seeing his
utter destitution, and hopeless of payment, a receiver of lodgers
should refuse to admit him into the hostelry. Accordingly,
he went to a tailor&#8217;s, and began to joke about his poverty.
Nothing is more apt to bring people into good humour; for, if
they are poor themselves, they enjoy the pleasure of discovering
that others are no better off; and, if not poor, there is the
consciousness of superiority.</p>

<p>&#8216;The favour I am about to ask of a man so wealthy and so
liberal as you are,&#8217; said Aulus, &#8216;is extremely small: you can
materially serve me, without the slightest loss, hazard, or
inconvenience. In few words, my valise is empty: and to some
ears an empty valise is louder and more discordant than a
bagpipe: I cannot say I like the sound of it myself. Give me
all the shreds and snippings you can spare me. They will feel
like clothes; not exactly so to me and my person, but to those
who are inquisitive, and who may be importunate.&#8217;</p>

<p>The tailor laughed, and distended both arms of Aulus with his
munificence. Soon was the valise well filled and rammed down.
Plenty of boys were in readiness to carry it to the boat. Aulus
waved them off, looking at some angrily, at others suspiciously.
Boarding the skiff, he lowered his treasure with care and caution,
staggering a little at the weight, and shaking it gently on deck,
with his ear against it: and then, finding all safe and compact,
he sat on it; but as tenderly as a pullet on her first eggs. When
he was landed, his care was even greater, and whoever came
near him was warned off with loud vociferations. Anxiously
as the other passengers were invited by the innkeepers to give
their houses the preference, Aulus was importuned most: the
others were only beset; he was borne off in triumphant captivity.
He ordered a bedroom, and carried his valise with him; he
ordered a bath, and carried with him his valise. He started
up from the company at dinner, struck his forehead, and cried
out, &#8216;Where is my valise?&#8217; &#8216;We are honest men here,&#8217; replied
the host. &#8216;You have left it, sir, in your chamber: where else
indeed should you leave it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Honesty is seated on your brow,&#8217; exclaimed Aulus; &#8216;but
there are few to be trusted in the world we live in. I now
believe I can eat.&#8217; And he gave a sure token of the belief that
was in him, not without a start now and then and a finger at
his ear, as if he heard somebody walking in the direction of his
bedchamber. Now began his first miracle: for now he contrived
to pick up, from time to time, a little money. In the
presence of his host and fellow-lodgers, he threw a few obols,
negligently and indifferently, among the beggars. &#8216;These poor
creatures,&#8217; said he, &#8216;know a new-comer as well as the gnats do:
in one half-hour I am half ruined by them; and this daily.&#8217;</p>

<p>Nearly a month had elapsed since his arrival, and no account
of board and lodging had been delivered or called for. Suspicion
at length arose in the host whether he really was rich. When
another man&#8217;s honesty is doubted, the doubter&#8217;s is sometimes
in jeopardy. The host was tempted to unsew the valise. To
his amazement and horror he found only shreds within it. However,
he was determined to be cautious, and to consult his wife,
who, although a Christian like Aulus, and much edified by his
discourses, might dissent from him in regard to a community
of goods, at least in her own household, and might defy him to
prove by any authority that the doctrine was meant for innkeepers.
Aulus, on his return in the evening, found out that his
valise had been opened. He hurried back, threw its contents
into the canal, and, borrowing an old cloak, he tucked it up
under his dress, and returned. Nobody had seen him enter
or come back again, nor was it immediately that his host or
hostess were willing to appear. But, after he had called them
loudly for some time, they entered his apartment: and he
thus addressed the woman:</p>

<p>&#8216;O Eucharis! no words are requisite to convince you (firm as
you are in the faith) of eternal verities, however mysterious.
But your unhappy husband has betrayed his incredulity in
regard to the most awful. If my prayers, offered up in our
holy temples all day long, have been heard, and that they have
been heard I feel within me the blessed certainty, something
miraculous has been vouchsafed for the conversion of this miserable
sinner. Until the present hour, the valise before you was
filled with precious relics from the apparel of saints and martyrs,
fresh as when on them.&#8217; &#8216;True, by Jove!&#8217; said the husband to
himself. &#8216;Within the present hour,&#8217; continued Aulus, &#8216;they are
united into one raiment, signifying our own union, our own
restoration.&#8217;</p>

<p>He drew forth the cloak, and fell on his face. Eucharis fell
also, and kissed the saintly head prostrate before her. The
host&#8217;s eyes were opened, and he bewailed his hardness of heart.
Aulus is now occupied in strengthening his faith, not without
an occasional support to the wife&#8217;s: all three live together
in unity.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> And do you make a joke even of this? Will
you never cease from the habitude?</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Too soon. The farther we descend into the vale of
years, the fewer illusions accompany us: we have little inclination,
little time, for jocularity and laughter. Light things are
easily detached from us, and we shake off heavier as we can.
Instead of levity, we are liable to moroseness: for always near
the grave there are more briers than flowers, unless we plant
them ourselves, or our friends supply them.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Thinking thus, do you continue to dissemble
or to distort the truth? The shreds are become a cable for the
faithful. That they were miraculously turned into one entire
garment who shall gainsay? How many hath it already clothed
with righteousness? Happy men, casting their doubts away
before it! Who knows, O Cousin Lucian, but on some future
day you yourself will invoke the merciful interposition of Aulus!</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Possibly: for if ever I fall among thieves, nobody is
likelier to be at the head of them.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Uncharitable man! how suspicious! how ungenerous!
how hardened in unbelief! Reason is a bladder on
which you may paddle like a child as you swim in summer
waters: but, when the winds rise and the waves roughen, it
slips from under you, and you sink; yes, O Lucian, you sink
into a gulf whence you never can emerge.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I deem those the wisest who exert the soonest their
own manly strength, now with the stream and now against it,
enjoying the exercise in fine weather, venturing out in foul, if
need be, yet avoiding not only rocks and whirlpools, but also
shallows. In such a light, my cousin, I look on your dispensations.
I shut them out as we shut out winds blowing from the
desert; hot, debilitating, oppressive, laden with impalpable
sands and pungent salts, and inflicting an incurable blindness.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Well, Cousin Lucian! I can bear all you say while
you are not witty. Let me bid you farewell in this happy interval.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Is it not serious and sad, O my cousin, that what the
Deity hath willed to lie incomprehensible in His mysteries, we
should fall upon with tooth and nail, and ferociously growl over,
or ignorantly dissect?</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Ho! now you come to be serious and sad, there are
hopes of you. Truth always begins or ends so.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Undoubtedly. But I think it more reverential to
abstain from that which, with whatever effort, I should never
understand.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> You are lukewarm, my cousin, you are lukewarm.
A most dangerous state.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> For milk to continue in, not for men. I would not
fain be frozen or scalded.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Alas! you are blind, my sweet cousin!</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Well; do not open my eyes with pincers, nor compose
for them a collyrium of spurge.</p>

<p>May not men eat and drink and talk together, and perform
in relation one to another all the duties of social life, whose
opinions are different on things immediately under their eyes?
If they can and do, surely they may as easily on things equally
above the comprehension of each party. The wisest and most
virtuous man in the whole extent of the Roman Empire is
Plutarch of Cheronaea: yet Plutarch holds a firm belief in the
existence of I know not how many gods, every one of whom
has committed notorious misdemeanours. The nearest to the
Cheronaean in virtue and wisdom is Trajan, who holds all the
gods dog-cheap. These two men are friends. If either of them
were influenced by your religion, as inculcated and practised
by the priesthood, he would be the enemy of the other, and
wisdom and virtue would plead for the delinquent in vain.
When your religion had existed, as you tell us, about a century,
Caius Caecilius, of Novum Comum, was proconsul in Bithynia.
Trajan, the mildest and most equitable of mankind, desirous
to remove from them, as far as might be, the hatred and invectives
of those whose old religion was assailed by them, applied
to Caecilius for information on their behaviour as good citizens.
The reply of Caecilius was favourable. Had Trajan applied
to the most eminent and authoritative of the sect, they would
certainly have brought into jeopardy all who differed in one
tittle from any point of their doctrine or discipline. For the
thorny and bitter aloe of dissension required less than a century
to flower on the steps of your temple.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> You are already half a Christian, in exposing to
the world the vanities both of philosophy and of power.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I have done no such thing: I have exposed the
vanities of the philosophizing and the powerful. Philosophy
is admirable; and Power may be glorious: the one conduces to
truth, the other has nearly all the means of conferring peace and
happiness, but it usually, and indeed almost always, takes a
contrary direction. I have ridiculed the futility of speculative
minds, only when they would pave the clouds instead of the
streets. To see distant things better than near is a certain
proof of a defective sight. The people I have held in derision
never turn their eyes to what they can see, but direct them
continually where nothing is to be seen. And this, by their
disciples, is called the sublimity of speculation! There is little
merit acquired, or force exhibited, in blowing off a feather that
would settle on my nose: and this is all I have done in regard to
the philosophers: but I claim for myself the approbation of
humanity, in having shown the true dimensions of the great.
The highest of them are no higher than my tunic; but they
are high enough to trample on the necks of those wretches who
throw themselves on the ground before them.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Was Alexander of Macedon no higher?</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> What region of the earth, what city, what theatre,
what library, what private study, hath he enlightened? If
you are silent, I may well be. It is neither my philosophy
nor your religion which casts the blood and bones of men in
their faces, and insists on the most reverence for those who have
made the most unhappy. If the Romans scourged by the hands
of children the schoolmaster who would have betrayed them,
how greatly more deserving of flagellation, from the same
quarter, are those hundreds of pedagogues who deliver up the
intellects of youth to such immoral revellers and mad murderers!
They would punish a thirsty child for purloining a bunch of
grapes from a vineyard, and the same men on the same day
would insist on his reverence for the subverter of Tyre, the
plunderer of Babylon, and the incendiary of Persepolis. And
are these men teachers? are these men philosophers? are these
men priests? Of all the curses that ever afflicted the earth, I
think Alexander was the worst. Never was he in so little mischief
as when he was murdering his friends.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Yet he built this very city; a noble and opulent
one when Rome was of hurdles and rushes.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> He built it! I wish, O Timotheus! he had been as
well employed as the stone-cutters or the plasterers. No, no:
the wisest of architects planned the most beautiful and commodious
of cities, by which, under a rational government and
equitable laws, Africa might have been civilized to the centre,
and the palm have extended her conquests through the remotest
desert. Instead of which, a dozen of Macedonian thieves
rifled a dying drunkard and murdered his children. In process
of time, another drunkard reeled hitherward from Rome, made
an easy mistake in mistaking a palace for a brothel, permitted
a stripling boy to beat him soundly, and a serpent to receive
the last caresses of his paramour.</p>

<p>Shame upon historians and pedagogues for exciting the
worst passions of youth by the display of such false glories!
If your religion hath any truth or influence, her professors will
extinguish the promontory lights, which only allure to breakers.
They will be assiduous in teaching the young and ardent that
great abilities do not constitute great men, without the right
and unremitting application of them; and that, in the sight of
Humanity and Wisdom, it is better to erect one cottage than to
demolish a hundred cities. Down to the present day we have
been taught little else than falsehood. We have been told to
do this thing and that: we have been told we shall be punished
unless we do: but at the same time we are shown by the finger
that prosperity and glory, and the esteem of all about us, rest
upon other and very different foundations. Now, do the ears
or the eyes seduce the most easily and lead the most directly to
the heart? But both eyes and ears are won over, and alike are
persuaded to corrupt us.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Cousin Lucian, I was leaving you with the
strangest of all notions in my head. I began to think for a
moment that you doubted my sincerity in the religion I profess;
and that a man of your admirable good sense, and at your
advanced age, could reject that only sustenance which supports
us through the grave into eternal life.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I am the most docile and practicable of men, and
never reject what people set before me: for if it is bread, it is
good for my own use; if bone or bran, it will do for my dog or
mule. But, although you know my weakness and facility, it
is unfair to expect I should have admitted at once what the
followers and personal friends of your Master for a long time
hesitated to receive. I remember to have read in one of the
early commentators, that His disciples themselves could not
swallow the miracle of the loaves; and one who wrote more
recently says, that even His brethren did not believe in Him.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Yet, finally, when they have looked over each
other&#8217;s accounts, they cast them up, and make them all tally
in the main sum; and if one omits an article, the next supplies
its place with a commodity of the same value. What would
you have? But it is of little use to argue on religion with a
man who, professing his readiness to believe, and even his
credulity, yet disbelieves in miracles.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I should be obstinate and perverse if I disbelieved
in the existence of a thing for no better reason than because
I never saw it, and cannot understand its operations. Do you
believe, O Timotheus, that Perictione, the mother of Plato,
became his mother by the sole agency of Apollo&#8217;s divine spirit,
under the phantasm of that god?</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> I indeed believe such absurdities?</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> You touch me on a vital part if you call an absurdity
the religion or philosophy in which I was educated. Anaxalides,
and Clearagus, and Speusippus, his own nephew, assert it.
Who should know better than they?</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Where are their proofs?</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I would not be so indelicate as to require them on
such an occasion. A short time ago I conversed with an old
centurion, who was in service by the side of Vespasian, when
Titus, and many officers and soldiers of the army, and many
captives, were present, and who saw one Eleazar put a ring
to the nostril of a demoniac (as the patient was called) and draw
the demon out of it.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> And do you pretend to believe this nonsense?</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I only believe that Vespasian and Titus had nothing
to gain or accomplish by the miracle; and that Eleazar, if he
had been detected in a trick by two acute men and several
thousand enemies, had nothing to look forward to but a cross&mdash;the
only piece of upholstery for which Judea seems to have
either wood or workmen, and which are as common in that
country as direction-posts are in any other.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> The Jews are a stiff-necked people.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> On such occasions, no doubt.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Would you, O Lucian, be classed among the
atheists, like Epicurus?</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> It lies not at my discretion what name shall be given
me at present or hereafter, any more than it did at my birth.
But I wonder at the ignorance and precipitancy of those who
call Epicurus an atheist. He saw on the same earth with
himself a great variety of inferior creatures, some possessing
more sensibility and more thoughtfulness than others. Analogy
would lead so contemplative a reasoner to the conclusion that
if many were inferior and in sight, others might be superior
and out of sight. He never disbelieved in the existence of the
gods; he only disbelieved that they troubled their heads with
our concerns. Have they none of their own? If they are happy,
does their happiness depend on us, comparatively so imbecile
and vile? He believed, as nearly all nations do, in different
ranks and orders of superhuman beings; and perhaps he thought
(but I never was in his confidence or counsels) that the higher
were rather in communication with the next to them in intellectual
faculties, than with the most remote. To me the suggestion
appears by no means irrational, that if we are managed
or cared for at all by beings wiser than ourselves (which in truth
would be no sign of any great wisdom in them), it can only
be by such as are very far from perfection, and who indulge us
in the commission of innumerable faults and follies, for their
own speculation or amusement.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> There is only one such; and he is the devil.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> If he delights in our wickedness, which you believe,
he must be incomparably the happiest of beings, which you do
not believe. No god of Epicurus rests his elbow on his armchair
with less energetic exertion or discomposure.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> We lead holier and purer lives than such ignorant
mortals as are not living under Grace.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I also live under Grace, O Timotheus! and I
venerate her for the pleasures I have received at her hands.
I do not believe she has quite deserted me. If my grey
hairs are unattractive to her, and if the trace of her fingers
is lost in the wrinkles of my forehead, still I sometimes am
told it is discernible even on the latest and coldest of my
writings.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> You are wilful in misapprehension. The Grace
of which I speak is adverse to pleasure and impurity.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Rightly do you separate impurity and pleasure,
which indeed soon fly asunder when the improvident would
unite them. But never believe that tenderness of heart signifies
corruption of morals, if you happen to find it (which indeed is
unlikely) in the direction you have taken; on the contrary, no
two qualities are oftener found together, on mind as on matter,
than hardness and lubricity.</p>

<p>Believe me, Cousin Timotheus, when we come to eighty years
of age we are all Essenes. In our kingdom of heaven there is
no marrying or giving in marriage; and austerity in ourselves,
when Nature holds over us the sharp instrument with which
Jupiter operated on Saturn, makes us austere to others. But
how happens it that you, both old and young, break every
bond which connected you anciently with the Essenes? Not
only do you marry (a height of wisdom to which I never have
attained, although in others I commend it), but you never
share your substance with the poorest of your community, as
they did, nor live simply and frugally, nor purchase nor employ
slaves, nor refuse rank and offices in the State, nor abstain from
litigation, nor abominate and execrate the wounds and cruelties
of war. The Essenes did all this, and greatly more, if Josephus
and Philo, whose political and religious tenets are opposite to
theirs, are credible and trustworthy.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Doubtless you would also wish us to retire into
the desert, and eschew the conversation of mankind.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> No, indeed; but I would wish the greater part of
your people to eschew mine, for they bring all the worst of the
desert with them whenever they enter; its smothering heats,
its blinding sands, its sweeping suffocation. Return to the pure
spirit of the Essenes, without their asceticism; cease from controversy,
and drop party designations. If you will not do this,
do less, and be merely what you profess to be, which is quite
enough for an honest, a virtuous, and a religious man.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Cousin Lucian, I did not come hither to receive
a lecture from you.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I have often given a dinner to a friend who did not
come to dine with me.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Then, I trust, you gave him something better
for dinner than bay-salt and dandelions. If you will not assist
us in nettling our enemies a little for their absurdities and
impositions, let me entreat you, however, to let us alone, and to
make no remarks on us. I myself run into no extravagances,
like the Essenes, washing and fasting, and retiring into solitude.
I am not called to them; when I am, I go.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I am apprehensive the Lord may afflict you with
deafness in that ear.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Nevertheless, I am indifferent to the world, and
all things in it. This, I trust, you will acknowledge to be true
religion and true philosophy.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> That is not philosophy which betrays an indifference
to those for whose benefit philosophy was designed; and those
are the whole human race. But I hold it to be the most unphilosophical
thing in the world to call away men from useful
occupations and mutual help, to profitless speculations and
acrid controversies. Censurable enough, and contemptible,
too, is that supercilious philosopher, sneeringly sedate, who
narrates in full and flowing periods the persecutions and tortures
of a fellow-man, led astray by his credulity, and ready to die in
the assertion of what in his soul he believes to be the truth.
But hardly less censurable, hardly less contemptible, is the
tranquilly arrogant sectarian, who denies that wisdom or
honesty can exist beyond the limits of his own ill-lighted
chamber.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> What! is he sanguinary?</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Whenever he can be, he is; and he always has it in
his power to be even worse than that, for he refuses his custom
to the industrious and honest shopkeeper who has been taught
to think differently from himself in matters which he has had
no leisure to study, and by which, if he had enjoyed that leisure,
he would have been a less industrious and a less expert artificer.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> We cannot countenance those hard-hearted men
who refuse to hear the word of the Lord.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> The hard-hearted knowing this of the tender-hearted,
and receiving the declaration from their own lips, will
refuse to hear the word of the Lord all their lives.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Well, well; it cannot be helped. I see, cousin,
my hopes of obtaining a little of your assistance in your own
pleasant way are disappointed; but it is something to have
conceived a better hope of saving your soul, from your readiness
to acknowledge your belief in miracles.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Miracles have existed in all ages and in all religions.
Witnesses to some of them have been numerous; to others of
them fewer. Occasionally, the witnesses have been disinterested
in the result.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Now indeed you speak truly and wisely.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> But sometimes the most honest and the most
quiescent have either been unable or unwilling to push themselves
so forward as to see clearly and distinctly the whole
of the operation; and have listened to some knave who felt a
pleasure in deluding their credulity, or some other who himself
was either an enthusiast or a dupe. It also may have happened
in the ancient religions, of Egypt for instance, or of India, or
even of Greece, that narratives have been attributed to authors
who never heard of them; and have been circulated by honest
men who firmly believed them; by half-honest, who indulged
their vanity in becoming members of a novel and bustling
society; and by utterly dishonest, who, having no other means
of rising above the shoulders of the vulgar, threw dust into their
eyes and made them stoop.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Ha! the rogues! It is nearly all over with them.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> Let us hope so. Parthenius and the Roman poet
Ovidius Naso, have related the transformations of sundry men,
women, and gods.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> Idleness! Idleness! I never read such lying
authors.</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I myself have seen enough to incline me toward a
belief in them.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> You? Why! you have always been thought an
utter infidel; and now you are running, hot and heedless as any
mad dog, to the opposite extreme!</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> I have lived to see, not indeed one man, but certainly
one animal turned into another; nay, great numbers. I have
seen sheep with the most placid faces in the morning, one
nibbling the tender herb with all its dew upon it; another,
negligent of its own sustenance, and giving it copiously to the
tottering lamb aside it.</p>

<p><i>Timotheus.</i> How pretty! half poetical!</p>

<p><i>Lucian.</i> In the heat of the day I saw the very same sheep
tearing off each other&#8217;s fleeces with long teeth and longer claws,
and imitating so admirably the howl of wolves, that at last the
wolves came down on them in a body, and lent their best assistance
at the general devouring. What is more remarkable,
the people of the villages seemed to enjoy the sport; and,
instead of attacking the wolves, waited until they had filled
their stomachs, ate the little that was left, said piously and
from the bottom of their hearts what you call <i>grace</i>, and
went home singing and piping.</p>

<h2><a name="BISHOP_SHIPLEY_AND_BENJAMIN_FRANKLIN" id="BISHOP_SHIPLEY_AND_BENJAMIN_FRANKLIN"></a>BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN</h2>


<p><i>Shipley.</i> There are very few men, even in the bushes and the
wilderness, who delight in the commission of cruelty; but
nearly all, throughout the earth, are censurable for the admission.
When we see a blow struck, we go on and think no more
about it: yet every blow aimed at the most distant of our
fellow-creatures, is sure to come back, some time or other, to our
families and descendants. He who lights a fire in one quarter
is ignorant to what other the winds may carry it, and whether
what is kindled in the wood may not break out again in the
cornfield.</p>

<p><i>Franklin.</i> If we could restrain but one generation from deeds
of violence, the foundation for a new and a more graceful edifice
of society would not only have been laid, but would have been
consolidated.</p>

<p><i>Shipley.</i> We already are horrified at the bare mention of
religious wars; we should then be horrified at the mention of
political. Why should they who, when they are affronted or
offended, abstain from inflicting blows, some from a sense of
decorousness and others from a sense of religion, be forward to
instigate the infliction of ten thousand, all irremediable, all
murderous? Every chief magistrate should be arbitrator and
umpire in all differences between any two, forbidding war.
Much would be added to the dignity of the most powerful king
by rendering him an efficient member of such a grand Amphictyonic
council. Unhappily they are persuaded in childhood
that a reign is made glorious by a successful war. What schoolmaster
ever taught a boy to question it? or indeed any point
of political morality, or any incredible thing in history? Caesar
and Alexander are uniformly clement: Themistocles died by a
draught of bull&#8217;s blood: Portia by swallowing red-hot pieces of
charcoal.</p>

<p><i>Franklin.</i> Certainly no woman or man could perform either
of these feats. In my opinion it lies beyond a doubt that
Portia suffocated herself by the fumes of charcoal; and that
the Athenian, whose stomach must have been formed on the
model of other stomachs, and must therefore have rejected a
much less quantity of blood than would have poisoned him,
died by some chemical preparation, of which a bull&#8217;s blood might,
or might not, have been part. Schoolmasters who thus betray
their trust, ought to be scourged by their scholars, like him of
their profession who underwent the just indignation of the
Roman Consul. You shut up those who are infected with the
plague; why do you lay no coercion on those who are incurably
possessed by the legion devil of carnage? When a creature is
of intellect so perverted that he can discern no difference between
a review and a battle, between the animating bugle and the
dying groan, it were expedient to remove him, as quietly as
may be, from his devastation of God&#8217;s earth and his usurpation
of God&#8217;s authority. Compassion points out the cell for him at
the bottom of the hospital, and listens to hear the key turned
in the ward: until then the house is insecure.</p>

<p><i>Shipley.</i> God grant our rulers wisdom, and our brethren peace!</p>

<p><i>Franklin.</i> Here are but indifferent specimens and tokens.
Those fellows throw stones pretty well: if they practise much
longer, they will hit us: let me entreat you, my lord, to leave me
here. So long as the good people were contented with hooting
and shouting at us, no great harm was either done or apprehended:
but now they are beginning to throw stones, perhaps
they may prove themselves more dexterous in action than their
rulers have done latterly in council.</p>

<p><i>Shipley.</i> Take care, Doctor Franklin! <i>That</i> was very near
being the philosopher&#8217;s stone.</p>

<p><i>Franklin.</i> Let me pick it up, then, and send it to London by
the diligence. But I am afraid your ministers, and the nation
at large, are as little in the way of wealth as of wisdom, in the
experiment they are making.</p>

<p><i>Shipley.</i> While I was attending to you, William had started.
Look! he has reached them: they are listening to him. Believe
me, he has all the courage of an Englishman and of a Christian;
and, if the stoutest of them force him to throw off his new black
coat, the blusterer would soon think it better to have listened
to less polemical doctrine.</p>

<p><i>Franklin.</i> Meantime a few of the town boys are come nearer,
and begin to grow troublesome. I am sorry to requite your
hospitality with such hard fare.</p>

<p><i>Shipley.</i> True, these young bakers make their bread very
gritty, but we must partake of it together so long as you are
with us.</p>

<p><i>Franklin.</i> Be pleased, my lord, to give us grace; our repast
is over; this is my boat.</p>

<p><i>Shipley.</i> We will accompany you as far as to the ship.
Thank God! we are now upon the water, and all safe. Give
me your hand, my good Doctor Franklin! and although you
have failed in the object of your mission, yet the intention will
authorize me to say, in the holy words of our Divine Redeemer,
Blessed are the peacemakers!</p>

<p><i>Franklin.</i> My dear lord! if God ever blessed a man at the
intercession of another, I may reasonably and confidently hope
in such a benediction. Never did one arise from a warmer, a
tenderer, or a purer heart.</p>

<p><i>Shipley.</i> Infatuation! that England should sacrifice to her
king so many thousands of her bravest men, and ruin so many
thousands of her most industrious, in a vain attempt to destroy
the very principles on which her strength and her glory are
founded! The weakest prince that ever sat upon a throne, and
the most needy and sordid Parliament that ever pandered to
distempered power, are thrusting our blindfold nation from the
pinnacle of prosperity.</p>

<p><i>Franklin.</i> I believe <i>your</i> king (from this moment it is permitted
me to call him <i>ours</i> no longer) to be as honest and as
wise a man as any of those about him: but unhappily he can see
no difference between a review and a battle. Such are the
optics of most kings and rulers. His Parliament, in both Houses,
acts upon calculation. There is hardly a family, in either, that
does not anticipate the clear profit of several thousands a year,
to itself and its connexions. Appointments to regiments and
frigates raise the price of papers; and forfeited estates fly
confusedly about, and darken the air from the Thames to the
Atlantic.</p>

<p><i>Shipley.</i> It is lamentable to think that war, bringing with it
every species of human misery, should become a commercial
speculation. Bad enough when it arises from revenge; another
word for honour.</p>

<p><i>Franklin.</i> A strange one indeed! but not more strange than
fifty others that come under the same title. Wherever there
is nothing of religion, nothing of reason, nothing of truth, we
come at once to honour; and here we draw the sword, dispense
with what little of civilization we ever pretended to, and murder
or get murdered, as may happen. But these ceremonials
both begin and end with an appeal to God, who, before we
appealed to Him, plainly told us we should do no such thing,
and that He would punish us most severely if we did. And yet,
my lord, even the gentlemen upon your bench turn a deaf ear
to Him on these occasions: nay, they go further; they pray to
Him for success in that which He has forbidden so strictly, and
when they have broken His commandment, thank Him. Upon
seeing these mockeries and impieties age after age repeated, I
have asked myself whether the depositaries and expounders
of religion have really any whatever of their own; or rather,
like the lawyers, whether they do not defend professionally a
cause that otherwise does not interest them in the least. Surely,
if these holy men really believed in a just retributive God,
they would never dare to utter the word <i>war</i>, without horror
and deprecation.</p>

<p><i>Shipley.</i> Let us attribute to infirmity what we must else
attribute to wickedness.</p>

<p><i>Franklin.</i> Willingly would I: but children are whipped
severely for inobservance of things less evident, for disobedience
of commands less audible and less awful. I am loath to attribute
cruelty to your order: men so entirely at their ease have seldom
any. Certain I am that several of the bishops would not have
patted Cain upon the back while he was about to kill Abel;
and my wonder is that the very same holy men encourage
their brothers in England to kill their brothers in America;
not one, not two nor three, but thousands, many thousands.</p>

<p><i>Shipley.</i> I am grieved at the blindness with which God has
afflicted us for our sins. These unhappy men are little aware
what combustibles they are storing under the Church, and how
soon they may explode. Even the wisest do not reflect on the
most important and the most certain of things; which is, that
every act of inhumanity and injustice goes far beyond what is
apparent at the time of its commission; that these, and all other
things, have their consequences; and that the consequences are
infinite and eternal. If this one truth alone could be deeply
impressed upon the hearts of men, it would regenerate the whole
human race.</p>

<p><i>Franklin.</i> In regard to politics, I am not quite certain whether
a politician may not be too far-sighted: but I am quite certain
that, if it be a fault, it is one into which few have fallen. The
policy of the Romans in the time of the republic, seems to have
been prospective. Some of the Dutch also, and of the Venetians,
used the telescope. But in monarchies the prince, not the
people, is consulted by the minister of the day; and what
pleases the weakest supersedes what is approved by the wisest.</p>

<p><i>Shipley.</i> We have had great statesmen: Burleigh, Cromwell,
Marlborough, Somers: and whatever may have been in the
eyes of a moralist the vices of Walpole, none ever understood
more perfectly, or pursued more steadily, the direct and palpable
interests of the country. Since his administration, our affairs
have never been managed by men of business; and it was more
than could have been expected that, in our war against the
French in Canada, the appointment fell on an able commander.</p>

<p><i>Franklin.</i> Such an anomaly is unlikely to recur. You have
in the English Parliament (I speak of both Houses) only two
great men; only two considerate and clear-sighted politicians;
Chatham and Burke. Three or four can say clever things;
several have sonorous voices; many vibrate sharp comminations
from the embrasures of portentously slit sleeves; and there
are those to be found who deliver their oracles out of wigs as
worshipful as the curls of Jupiter, however they may be
grumbled at by the flour-mills they have laid under such heavy
contribution; yet nearly all of all parties want alike the sagacity
to discover that in striking America you shake Europe; that
kings will come out of the war either to be victims or to be
despots; and that within a quarter of a century they will be
hunted down like vermin by the most servile nations, or slain
in their palaces by their own courtiers. In a peace of twenty
years you might have paid off the greater part of your National
Debt, indeed as much of it as it would be expedient to discharge,
and you would have left your old enemy France labouring and
writhing under the intolerable and increasing weight of hers.
This is the only way in which you can ever quite subdue her;
and in this you subdue her without a blow, without a menace,
and without a wrong. As matters now stand, you are calling
her from attending to the corruptions of her court, and inviting
her from bankruptcy to glory.</p>

<p><i>Shipley.</i> I see not how bankruptcy can be averted by the
expenditure of war.</p>

<p><i>Franklin.</i> It cannot. But war and glory are the same thing
to France, and she sings as shrilly and as gaily after a beating
as before. With a subsidy to a less amount than she has lately
been accustomed to squander in six weeks, and with no more
troops than would garrison a single fortress, she will enable us
to set you at defiance, and to do you a heavier injury in two
campaigns than she has been able to do in two centuries,
although your king was in her pay against you. She will
instantly be our ally, and soon our scholar. Afterward she will
sell her crown jewels and her church jewels, which cover the
whole kingdom, and will derive unnatural strength from her
vices and her profligacy. You ought to have conciliated us
as your ally, and to have had no other, excepting Holland and
Denmark. England could never have, unless by her own folly,
more than one enemy. Only one is near enough to strike her;
and that one is down. All her wars for six hundred years have
not done this; and the first trumpet will untrance her. You
leave your house open to incendiaries while you are running
after a refractory child. Had you laid down the rod, the child
would have come back. And because he runs away from the
rod, you take up the poker. Seriously, what means do you
possess of enforcing your unjust claims and insolent authority?
Never since the Norman Conquest had you an army so utterly
inefficient, or generals so notoriously unskilful: no, not even in
the reign of that venal traitor, that French stipendiary, the
second Charles. Those were yet living who had fought bravely
for his father, and those also who had vanquished him: and
Victory still hovered over the mast that had borne the banners
of our Commonwealth: <i>ours</i>, <i>ours</i>, my lord! the word is the
right word here.</p>

<p><i>Shipley.</i> I am depressed in spirit, and can sympathize but
little in your exultation. All the crimes of Nero and Caligula
are less afflicting to humanity, and consequently we may
suppose will bring down on the offenders a less severe retribution,
than an unnecessary and unjust war. And yet the authors
and abettors of this most grievous among our earthly calamities,
the enactors and applauders (on how vast a theatre!) of the first
and greatest crime committed upon earth, are quiet complacent
creatures, jovial at dinner, hearty at breakfast, and refreshed
with sleep! Nay, the prime movers in it are called most
religious and most gracious; and the hand that signs in cold
blood the death-warrant of nations, is kissed by the kind-hearted,
and confers distinction upon the brave! The prolongation of
a life that shortens so many others, is prayed for by the conscientious
and the pious! Learning is inquisitive in the research
of phrases to celebrate him who has conferred such blessings,
and the eagle of genius holds the thunderbolt by his throne!
Philosophy, O my friend, has hitherto done little for the social
state; and Religion has nearly all her work to do! She too hath
but recently washed her hands from blood, and stands neutrally
by, yes, worse than neutrally, while others shed it. I am convinced
that no day of my life will be so censured by my own
clergy, as this, the day on which the last hopes of peace have
abandoned us, and the only true minister of it is pelted from our
shores. Farewell, until better times! may the next generation
be wiser! and wiser it surely will be, for the lessons of Calamity
are far more impressive than those which repudiated Wisdom
would have taught.</p>

<p><i>Franklin.</i> Folly hath often the same results as Wisdom:
but Wisdom would not engage in her schoolroom so expensive
an assistant as Calamity. There are, however, some noisy and
unruly children whom she alone has the method of rendering
tame and tractable: perhaps it may be by setting them to
their tasks both sore and supperless. The ship is getting under
weigh. Adieu once more, my most reverend and noble friend!
Before me in imagination do I see America, beautiful as Leda
in her infant smiles, when her father Jove first raised her from
the earth; and behind me I leave England, hollow, unsubstantial,
and broken, as the shell she burst from.</p>

<p><i>Shipley.</i> O worst of miseries, when it is impiety to pray that
our country may be successful. Farewell! may every good
attend you! with as little of evil to endure or to inflict, as
national sins can expect from the Almighty.</p>

<h2><a name="SOUTHEY_AND_LANDOR" id="SOUTHEY_AND_LANDOR"></a>SOUTHEY AND LANDOR</h2>


<p><i>Southey.</i> Of all the beautiful scenery round King&#8217;s Weston
the view from this terrace, and especially from this sundial,
is the pleasantest.</p>

<p><i>Landor.</i> The last time I ever walked hither in company
(which, unless with ladies, I rarely have done anywhere) was
with a just, a valiant, and a memorable man, Admiral Nichols,
who usually spent his summer months at the village of Shirehampton,
just below us. There, whether in the morning or
evening, it was seldom I found him otherwise engaged than in
cultivating his flowers.</p>

<p><i>Southey.</i> I never had the same dislike to company in my
walks and rambles as you profess to have, but of which I perceived
no sign whatever when I visited you, first at Llanthony
Abbey and afterward on the Lake of Como. Well do I remember
our long conversations in the silent and solitary church
of Sant&#8217; Abondio (surely the coolest spot in Italy), and how
often I turned back my head toward the open door, fearing lest
some pious passer-by, or some more distant one in the wood
above, pursuing the pathway that leads to the tower of Luitprand,
should hear the roof echo with your laughter, at the stories
you had collected about the brotherhood and sisterhood of
the place.</p>

<p><i>Landor.</i> I have forgotten most of them, and nearly all: but
I have not forgotten how we speculated on the possibility that
Milton might once have been sitting on the very bench we then
occupied, although we do not hear of his having visited that
part of the country. Presently we discoursed on his poetry;
as we propose to do again this morning.</p>

<p><i>Southey.</i> In that case, it seems we must continue to be seated
on the turf.</p>

<p><i>Landor.</i> Why so?</p>

<p><i>Southey.</i> Because you do not like to walk in company: it
might disturb and discompose you: and we never lose our
temper without losing at the same time many of our thoughts,
which are loath to come forward without it.</p>

<p><i>Landor.</i> From my earliest days I have avoided society as
much as I could decorously, for I received more pleasure in
the cultivation and improvement of my own thoughts than in
walking up and down among the thoughts of others. Yet, as
you know, I never have avoided the intercourse of men distinguished
by virtue and genius; of genius, because it warmed
and invigorated me by my trying to keep pace with it; of virtue,
that if I had any of my own it might be called forth by such
vicinity. Among all men elevated in station who have made a
noise in the world (admirable old expression!) I never saw any
in whose presence I felt inferiority, excepting Kosciusco. But
how many in the lower paths of life have exerted both virtues
and abilities which I never exerted, and never possessed! what
strength and courage and perseverance in some, in others what
endurance and forbearance! At the very moment when most,
beside yourself, catching up half my words, would call and
employ against me in its ordinary signification what ought to
convey the most honorific, the term <i>self-sufficiency</i>, I bow my
head before the humble, with greatly more than their humiliation.
You are better tempered than I am, and are readier to
converse. There are half-hours when, although in good humour
and good spirits, I would, not be disturbed by the necessity of
talking, to be the possessor of all the rich marshes we see yonder.
In this interval there is neither storm nor sunshine of the mind,
but calm and (as the farmer would call it) <i>growing</i> weather, in
which the blades of thought spring up and dilate insensibly.
Whatever I do, I must do in the open air, or in the silence of
night: either is sufficient: but I prefer the hours of exercise, or,
what is next to exercise, of field-repose. Did you happen to
know the admiral?</p>

<p><i>Southey.</i> Not personally: but I believe the terms you have
applied to him are well merited. After some experience, he
contended that public men, public women, and the public press,
may be all designated by one and the same trisyllable. He is
reported to have been a strict disciplinarian. In the mutiny
at the Nore he was seized by his crew, and summarily condemned
by them to be hanged. Many taunting questions were
asked him, to which he made no reply. When the rope was
fastened round his neck, the ringleader cried, &#8216;Answer this one
thing, however, before you go, sir! What would you do with
any of us, if we were in your power as you are now in ours?&#8217;
The admiral, then captain, looked sternly and contemptuously,
and replied, &#8216;Hang you, by God!&#8217; Enraged at this answer,
the mutineer tugged at the rope: but another on the instant
rushed forward, exclaiming, &#8216;No, captain!&#8217; (for thus he called
the fellow) &#8216;he has been cruel to us, flogging here and flogging
there, but before so brave a man is hanged like a dog, you heave
me overboard.&#8217; Others among the most violent now interceded:
and an old seaman, not saying a single word, came forward with
his knife in his hand, and cut the noose asunder. Nichols did
not thank him, nor notice him, nor speak: but, looking round
at the other ships, in which there was the like insubordination,
he went toward his cabin slow and silent. Finding it locked,
he called to a midshipman: &#8216;Tell that man with a knife to come
down and open the door.&#8217; After a pause of a few minutes, it
was done: but he was confined below until the quelling of the
mutiny.</p>

<p><i>Landor.</i> His conduct as Controller of the Navy was no less
magnanimous and decisive. In this office he presided at the
trial of Lord Melville. His lordship was guilty, we know, of all
the charges brought against him; but, having more patronage
than ever minister had before, he refused to answer the questions
which (to repeat his own expression) might incriminate him.
And his refusal was given with a smile of indifference, a
consciousness of security. In those days, as indeed in most others,
the main use of power was promotion and protection: and
<i>honest man</i> was never in any age among the titles of nobility,
and has always been the appellation used toward the feeble and
inferior by the prosperous. Nichols said on the present occasion,
&#8216;If this man is permitted to skulk away under such pretences,
trial is here a mockery.&#8217; Finding no support, he threw up his
office as Controller of the Navy, and never afterward entered
the House of Commons. Such a person, it appears to me, leads
us aptly and becomingly to that steadfast patriot on whose
writings you promised me your opinion; not incidentally, as
before, but turning page after page. It would ill beseem us to
treat Milton with generalities. Radishes and salt are the
picnic quota of slim spruce reviewers: let us hope to find somewhat
more solid and of better taste. Desirous to be a listener
and a learner when you discourse on his poetry, I have been
more occupied of late in examining the prose.</p>

<p><i>Southey.</i> Do you retain your high opinion of it?</p>

<p><i>Landor.</i> Experience makes us more sensible of faults than of
beauties. Milton is more correct than Addison, but less correct
than Hooker, whom I wish he had been contented to receive
as a model in style, rather than authors who wrote in another
and a poorer language; such, I think, you are ready to
acknowledge is the Latin.</p>

<p><i>Southey.</i> This was always my opinion.</p>

<p><i>Landor.</i> However, I do not complain that in oratory and
history his diction is sometimes poetical.</p>

<p><i>Southey.</i> Little do I approve of it in prose on any subject.
Demosthenes and Aeschines, Lisias and Isaeus, and finally
Cicero, avoided it.</p>

<p><i>Landor.</i> They did: but Chatham and Burke and Grattan did
not; nor indeed the graver and greater Pericles; of whom the
most memorable sentence on record is pure poetry. On the fall
of the young Athenians in the field of battle, he said, &#8216;The year
hath lost its spring.&#8217; But how little are these men, even
Pericles himself, if you compare them as men of genius with
Livy! In Livy, as in Milton, there are bursts of passion which
cannot by the nature of things be other than poetical, nor (being
so) come forth in other language. If Milton had executed his
design of writing a history of England, it would probably have
abounded in such diction, especially in the more turbulent
scenes and in the darker ages.</p>

<p><i>Southey.</i> There are quiet hours and places in which a taper
may be carried steadily, and show the way along the ground;
but you must stand a-tiptoe and raise a blazing torch above your
head, if you would bring to our vision the obscure and time-worn
figures depicted on the lofty vaults of antiquity. The philosopher
shows everything in one clear light; the historian
loves strong reflections and deep shadows, but, above all, prominent
and moving characters. We are little pleased with the
man who disenchants us: but whoever can make us wonder,
must himself (we think) be wonderful, and deserve our
admiration.</p>

<p><i>Landor.</i> Believing no longer in magic and its charms, we still
shudder at the story told by Tacitus, of those which were
discovered in the mournful house of Germanicus.</p>

<p><i>Southey.</i> Tacitus was also a great poet, and would have been
a greater, had he been more contented with the external and
ordinary appearances of things. Instead of which, he looked
at a part of his pictures through a prism, and at another part
through a <i>camera obscura</i>. If the historian were as profuse
of moral as of political axioms, we should tolerate him less:
for in the political we fancy a writer is but meditating; in the
moral we regard him as declaiming. In history we desire to
be conversant with only the great, according to our notions of
greatness: we take it as an affront, on such an invitation, to be
conducted into the lecture-room, or to be desired to amuse
ourselves in the study.</p>

<p><i>Landor.</i> Pray go on. I am desirous of hearing more.</p>

<p><i>Southey.</i> Being now alone, with the whole day before us,
and having carried, as we agreed at breakfast, each his Milton
in his pocket, let us collect all the graver faults we can lay our
hands upon, without a too minute and troublesome research;
not in the spirit of Johnson, but in our own.</p>

<p><i>Landor.</i> That is, abasing our eyes in reverence to so great a
man, but without closing them. The beauties of his poetry
we may omit to notice, if we can: but where the crowd claps the
hands, it will be difficult for us always to refrain. Johnson,
I think, has been charged unjustly with expressing too freely
and inconsiderately the blemishes of Milton. There are many
more of them than he has noticed.</p>

<p><i>Southey.</i> If we add any to the number, and the literary world
hears of it, we shall raise an outcry from hundreds who never
could see either his excellences or his defects, and from several
who never have perused the noblest of his writings.</p>

<p><i>Landor.</i> It may be boyish and mischievous, but I acknowledge
I have sometimes felt a pleasure in irritating, by the cast of a
pebble, those who stretch forward to the full extent of the chain
their open and frothy mouths against me. I shall seize upon
this conjecture of yours, and say everything that comes into my
head on the subject. Beside which, if any collateral thoughts
should spring up, I may throw them in also; as you perceive
I have frequently done in my <i>Imaginary Conversations</i>, and as
we always do in real ones.</p>

<p><i>Southey.</i> When we adhere to one point, whatever the form,
it should rather be called a disquisition than a conversation.
Most writers of dialogue take but a single stride into questions
the most abstruse, and collect a heap of arguments to be blown
away by the bloated whiffs of some rhetorical charlatan, tricked
out in a multiplicity of ribbons for the occasion.</p>

<p>Before we open the volume of poetry, let me confess to you
I admire his prose less than you do.</p>

<p><i>Landor.</i> Probably because you dissent more widely from
the opinions it conveys: for those who are displeased with
anything are unable to confine the displeasure to one spot.
We dislike everything a little when we dislike anything much.
It must indeed be admitted that his prose is often too latinized
and stiff. But I prefer his heavy cut velvet, with its ill-placed
Roman fibula, to the spangled gauze and gummed-on flowers
and puffy flounces of our present street-walking literature. So
do you, I am certain.</p>

<p><i>Southey.</i> Incomparably. But let those who have gone
astray, keep astray, rather than bring Milton into disrepute by
pushing themselves into his company and imitating his manner.
Milton is none of these: and his language is never a patchwork.
We find daily, in almost every book we open, expressions which
are not English, never were, and never will be: for the writers are
by no means of sufficiently high rank to be masters of the mint.
To arrive at this distinction, it is not enough to scatter in all
directions bold, hazardous, undisciplined thoughts: there must
be lordly and commanding ones, with a full establishment of
well-appointed expressions adequate to their maintenance.</p>

<p>Occasionally I have been dissatisfied with Milton, because
in my opinion that is ill said in prose which can be said more
plainly. Not so in poetry: if it were, much of Pindar and
Aeschylus, and no little of Dante, would be censurable.</p>

<p><i>Landor.</i> Acknowledge that he whose poetry I am holding in
my hand is free from every false ornament in his prose, unless
a few bosses of latinity may be called so; and I am ready to
admit the full claims of your favourite South. Acknowledge
that, heading all the forces of our language, he was the great
antagonist of every great monster which infested our country;
and he disdained to trim his lion-skin with lace. No other
English writer has equalled Raleigh, Hooker, and Milton, in
the loftier parts of their works.</p>

<p><i>Southey.</i> But Hooker and Milton, you allow, are sometimes
pedantic. In Hooker there is nothing so elevated as there is
in Raleigh.</p>

<p><i>Landor.</i> Neither he, however, nor any modern, nor any
ancient, has attained to that summit on which the sacred ark
of Milton strikes and rests. Reflections, such as we indulged
in on the borders of the Larius, come over me here again. Perhaps
from the very sod where you are sitting, the poet in his
youth sate looking at the Sabrina he was soon to celebrate.
There is pleasure in the sight of a glebe which never has been
broken; but it delights me particularly in those places where
great men have been before. I do not mean warriors: for
extremely few among the most remarkable of them will a considerate
man call great: but poets and philosophers and philanthropists,
the ornaments of society, the charmers of solitude,
the warders of civilization, the watchmen at the gate which
Tyranny would batter down, and the healers of those wounds
which she left festering in the field. And now, to reduce this
demon into its proper toad-shape again, and to lose sight of it,
open your <i>Paradise Lost</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_EMPEROR_OF_CHINA_AND_TSING-TI" id="THE_EMPEROR_OF_CHINA_AND_TSING-TI"></a>THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI</h2>


<p>On the morrow I was received at the folding-doors by Pru-Tsi,
and ushered by him into the presence of his majesty the
Emperor, who was graciously pleased to inform me that he had
rendered thanks to Almighty God for enlightening his mind,
and for placing his empire far beyond the influence of the
persecutor and fanatic. &#8216;But,&#8217; continued his majesty, &#8216;this
story of the sorcerer&#8217;s man quite confounds me. Little as the
progress is which the Europeans seem to have made in the
path of humanity, yet the English, we know, are less cruel than
their neighbours, and more given to reflection and meditation.
How then is it possible they should allow any portion of their
fellow-citizens to be hoodwinked, gagged, and carried away
into darkness, by such conspirators and assassins? Why didst
thou not question the man thyself?&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Tsing-Ti.</i> I did, O Emperor! and his reply was, &#8216;We can bury
such only as were in the household of the faith. It would be
a mockery to bid those spirits go in peace which we know are
condemned to everlasting fire.&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Emperor.</i> Amazing! have they that? Who invented it?
Everlasting fire! It surely might be applied to better purposes.
And have those rogues authority to throw people into it? In
what part of the kingdom is it? If natural, it ought to have
been marked more plainly in the maps. The English, no doubt,
are ashamed of letting it be known abroad that they have any
such places in their country. If artificial, it is no wonder they
keep such a secret to themselves. Tsing-Ti, I commend thy
prudence in asking no questions about it; for I see we are equally
at a loss on this curiosity.</p>

<p><i>Tsing-Ti.</i> The sorcerer has a secret for diluting it. Oysters
and the white of eggs, applied on lucky days, enter into the
composition; but certain charms in a strange language must also
be employed, and must be repeated a certain number of times.
There are stones likewise, and wood cut into particular forms,
good against this eternal fire, as they believe. The sorcerer
has the power, they pretend, of giving the faculty of hearing and
seeing to these stones and pieces of wood; and when he has
given them the faculties, they become so sensible and grateful,
they do whatever he orders. Some roll their eyes, some sweat,
some bleed; and the people beat their breasts before them, calling
themselves miserable sinners.</p>

<p><i>Emperor.</i> <i>Sinners</i> is not the name I should have given them,
although no doubt they are in the right.</p>

<p><i>Tsing-Ti.</i> Sometimes, if they will not bleed freely, nor sweat,
nor roll their eyes, the devouter break their heads with clubs,
and look out for others who will.</p>

<p><i>Emperor.</i> Take heed, Tsing-Ti! Take heed! I do believe
thou art talking all the while of idols. Thou must be respectful;
remember I am head of all the religions in the empire. We have
something in our own country not very unlike them, only the
people do not worship them; they merely fall down before
them as representatives of a higher power. So they say.</p>

<p><i>Tsing-Ti.</i> I do not imagine they go much farther in Europe,
excepting the introduction of this club-law into their adoration.</p>

<p><i>Emperor.</i> And difference enough, in all conscience. Our
people is less ferocious and less childish. If any man break an
idol here for not sweating, he himself would justly be condemned
to sweat, showing him how inconvenient a thing it is when the
sweater is not disposed. As for rolling the eyes, surely they
know best whom they should ogle; as for bleeding, that must be
regulated by the season of the year. Let every man choose his
idol as freely as he chooses his wife; let him be constant if he can;
if he cannot, let him at least be civil. Whoever dares to scratch
the face of any one in my empire, shall be condemned to varnish
it afresh, and moreover to keep it in repair all his lifetime.</p>

<p><i>Tsing-Ti.</i> In Europe such an offence would be punished with
the extremities of torture.</p>

<p><i>Emperor.</i> Perhaps their idols cost more, and are newer.
Is there no chance, in all their changes, that we may be called
upon to supply them with a few?</p>

<p><i>Tsing-Ti.</i> They have plenty for the present, and they dig
up fresh occasionally.</p>

<p><i>Emperor.</i> In regard to the worship of idols, they have not a
great deal to learn from us; and what is deficient will come by
degrees as they grow humaner. But how little care can any
ruler have for the happiness and improvement of his people,
who permits such ferocity in the priesthood. If its members
are employed by the government to preside at burials, as
according to thy discourse I suppose, a virtuous prince would
order a twelvemonth&#8217;s imprisonment, and spare diet, to whichever
of them should refuse to perform the last office of humanity
toward a fellow-creature. What separation of citizen from
citizen, and necessarily what diminution of national strength,
must be the consequence of such a system! A single act of it
ought to be punished more severely than any single act of
sedition, not only as being a greater distractor of civic union,
but, in its cruel sequestration of the best affections, a fouler
violator of domestic peace. I always had fancied, from the
books in my library, that the Christian religion was founded
on brotherly love and pure equality. I may calculate ill; but,
in my hasty estimate, damnation and dog-burial stand many
removes from these.</p>

<p>&#8216;Wait a little,&#8217; the Emperor continued: &#8216;I wish to read in
my library the two names that my father said are considered
the two greatest in the West, and may vie nearly with the highest
of our own country.&#8217;</p>

<p>Whereupon did his majesty walk forth into his library; and
my eyes followed his glorious figure as he passed through the
doorway, traversing the <i>gallery of the peacocks</i>, so called because
fifteen of those beautiful birds unite their tails in the centre
of the ceiling, painted so naturally as to deceive the beholder,
each carrying in his beak a different flower, the most beautiful
in China, and bending his neck in such a manner as to present
it to the passer below. Traversing this gallery, his majesty
with his own hand drew aside the curtain of the library door.
His majesty then entered; and, after some delay, he appeared
with two long scrolls, and shook them gently over the fish-pond,
in this dormitory of the sages. Suddenly there were so
many splashes and plunges that I was aware of the gratification
the fishes had received from the grubs in them, and the disappointment
in the atoms of dust. His majesty, with his own
right hand, drew the two scrolls trailing on the marble pavement,
and pointing to them with his left, said:</p>

<p>&#8216;Here they are; Nhu-Tong: Pa-Kong. Suppose they had
died where the sorcerer&#8217;s men held firm footing, would the
priests have refused them burial?&#8217;</p>

<p>I bowed my head at the question; for a single tinge of red,
whether arising from such ultra-bestial cruelty in those who
have the impudence to accuse the cannibals of theirs, or whether
from abhorrent shame at the corroding disease of intractable
superstition, hereditary in the European nations for fifteen
centuries, a tinge of red came over the countenance of the
emperor. When I raised up again my forehead, after such time
as I thought would have removed all traces of it, still fixing my
eyes on the ground, I answered:</p>

<p>&#8216;O Emperor! the most zealous would have done worse. They
would have prepared these great men for burial, and then have
left them unburied.&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Emperor.</i> So! so! they would have embalmed them, in their
reverence for meditation and genius, although their religion
prohibits the ceremony of interring them.</p>

<p><i>Tsing-Ti.</i> Alas, sire, my meaning is far different. They
would have dislocated their limbs with pulleys, broken them
with hammers, and then have burnt the flesh off the bones.
This is called an <i>act of faith</i>.</p>

<p><i>Emperor.</i> <i>Faith</i>, didst thou say? Tsing-Ti, thou speakest
bad Chinese: thy native tongue is strangely occidentalized.</p>

<p><i>Tsing-Ti.</i> So they call it.</p>

<p><i>Emperor.</i> God hath not given unto all men the use of speech.
Thou meanest to designate the ancient inhabitants of the
country, not those who have lived there within the last three
centuries.</p>

<p><i>Tsing-Ti.</i> The Spaniards and Italians (such are the names of
the nations who are most under the influence of the spells)
were never so barbarous and cruel as during the first of the last
three centuries. The milder of them would have refused two
cubits of earth to the two philosophers; and not only would
have rejected them from the cemetery of the common citizens,
but from the side of the common hangman; the most ignorant
priest thinking himself much wiser, and the most enlightened
prince not daring to act openly as one who could think otherwise.
The Italians had formerly two illustrious men among them; the
earlier was a poet, the later a philosopher; one was exiled, the
other was imprisoned, and both were within a span of being
burnt alive.</p>

<p><i>Emperor.</i> We have in Asia some odd religions and some
barbarous princes, but neither are like the Europeans. In
the name of God! do the fools think of their Christianity as our
neighbours in Tartary (with better reason) think of their milk;
that it will keep the longer for turning sour? or that it must be
wholesome because it is heady? Swill it out, swill it out, say I,
and char the tub.</p>



<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<h2><a name="LOUIS_XVIII_AND_TALLEYRAND" id="LOUIS_XVIII_AND_TALLEYRAND"></a>LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND</h2>


<p><i>Louis.</i> M. Talleyrand! in common with all my family, all
France, all Europe, I entertain the highest opinion of your
abilities and integrity. You have convinced me that your heart,
throughout the storms of the revolution, leaned constantly
toward royalty; and that you permitted and even encouraged
the caresses of the usurper, merely that you might strangle
the more certainly and the more easily his new-born empire.
After this, it is impossible to withhold my confidence from you.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> Conscious of the ridicule his arrogance and presumption
would incur, the usurper attempted to silence and
stifle it with other and far different emotions. Half his cruelties
were perpetrated that his vanity might not be wounded: for
scorn is superseded by horror. Whenever he committed an
action or uttered a sentiment which would render him an object
of derision, he instantly gave vent to another which paralysed
by its enormous wickedness. He would extirpate a nation to
extinguish a smile. No man alive could deceive your majesty:
the extremely few who would wish to do it, lie under that
vigilant and piercing eye, which discerned in perspective from
the gardens of Hartwell those of the Tuileries and Versailles.
As joy arises from calamity, so spring arises from the bosom of
winter, purely to receive your majesty, inviting the august
descendant of their glorious founder to adorn and animate
them again with his beneficent and gracious presence. The
waters murmur, in voices half-suppressed, the reverential hymn
of peace restored: the woods bow their heads....</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> Talking of woods, I am apprehensive all the game has
been woefully killed up in my forests.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> A single year will replenish them.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> Meanwhile! M. Talleyrand! meanwhile!</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> Honest and active and watchful gamekeepers,
in sufficient number, must be sought; and immediately.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> Alas! if the children of my nobility had been educated
like the children of the English, I might have promoted some
hundreds of them in this department. But their talents lie
totally within the binding of their breviaries. Those of them
who shoot, can shoot only with pistols; which accomplishment
they acquired in England, that they might challenge any of the
islanders who should happen to look with surprise or displeasure
in their faces, expecting to be noticed by them in
Paris, for the little hospitalities the proud young gentlemen,
and their prouder fathers, were permitted to offer them in
London and at their country-seats. What we call <i>reconnaissance</i>,
they call <i>gratitude</i>, treating a recollector like a debtor. This is
a want of courtesy, a defect in civilization, which it behoves
us to supply. Our memories are as tenacious as theirs, and
rather more eclectic.</p>

<p>Since my return to my kingdom I have undergone great
indignities from this unreflecting people. One Canova, a
sculptor at Rome, visited Paris in the name of the Pope, and in
quality of his envoy, and insisted on the cession of those statues
and pictures which were brought into France by the French
armies. He began to remove them out of the gallery: I told
him I would never give my consent: he replied, he thought it
sufficient that he had Wellington&#8217;s. Therefore, the next time
Wellington presented himself at the Tuileries, I turned my back
upon him before the whole court. Let the English and their
allies be aware, that I owe my restoration not to them, but
partly to God and partly to Saint Louis. They and their
armies are only brute instruments in the hands of my progenitor
and intercessor.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> Fortunate, that the conqueror of France bears
no resemblance to the conqueror of Spain. Peterborough (I
shudder at the idea) would have ordered a file of soldiers
to seat your Majesty in your travelling carriage, and would
have reinstalled you at Hartwell. The English people are so
barbarous, that he would have done it not only with impunity,
but with applause.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> But the sovereign of his country ... would the
sovereign suffer it?</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> Alas! sire! Confronted with such men, what are
sovereigns, when the people are the judges? Wellington can
drill armies: Peterborough could marshal nations.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> Thank God! we have no longer any such pests on earth.
The most consummate general of our days (such is Wellington)
sees nothing one single inch beyond the field of battle; and he is
so observant of discipline, that if I ordered him to be flogged
in the presence of the allied armies, he would not utter a complaint
nor shrug a shoulder; he would only write a dispatch.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> But his soldiers would execute the Duke of
Brunswick&#8217;s manifesto, and Paris would sink into her catacombs.
No man so little beloved was ever so well obeyed:
and there is not a man in England, of either party, citizen or
soldier, who would not rather die than see him disgraced.
His firmness, his moderation, his probity, place him more
opposite to Napoleon than he stood in the field of Waterloo.
These are his lofty lines of Torres Vedras, which no enemy dares
assail throughout their whole extent.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> M. Talleyrand! is it quite right to extol an enemy
and an Englishman in this manner?</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> Pardon! Sire! I stand corrected. Forgive me
a momentary fit of enthusiasm, in favour of those qualities by
which, although an Englishman&#8217;s, I am placed again in your
majesty&#8217;s service.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> We will now then go seriously to business. Wellington
and the allied armies have interrupted and occupied us. I will
instantly write, with my own hand, to the Marquis of Buckingham,
desiring him to send me five hundred pheasants&#8217; eggs.
I am restored to my throne, M. Talleyrand! but in what a
condition! Not a pheasant on the table! I must throw myself
on the mercy of foreigners, even for a pheasant! When I have
written my letter, I shall be ready to converse with you on the
business on which I desired your presence. [<i>Writes.</i>] Here; read
it. Give me your opinion: is not the note a model?</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> If the charms of language could be copied, it
would be. But what is intended for delight may terminate in
despair: and there are words which, unapproachable by distance
and sublimity, may wither the laurels on the most exalted of
literary brows.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> There is grace in that expression of yours, M. Talleyrand!
there is really no inconsiderable grace in it. Seal my
letter: direct it to the Marquis of Buckingham at Stowe. Wait:
open it again: no, no: write another in your own name: instruct
him how sure you are it will be agreeable to me, if he sends
at the same time fifty or a hundred brace of the birds as well as
the eggs. At present I am desolate. My heart is torn, M.
Talleyrand! it is almost plucked out of my bosom. I have no
other care, no other thought, day or night, but the happiness
of my people. The allies, who have most shamefully overlooked
the destitution of my kitchen, seem resolved to turn a
deaf ear to its cries evermore; nay, even to render them shriller
and shriller. The allies, I suspect, are resolved to execute the
design of the mischievous Pitt.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> May it please your majesty to inform me <i>which</i>
of them; for he formed a thousand, all mischievous, but greatly
more mischievous to England than to France. Resolved to
seize the sword, in his drunkenness, he seized it by the edge,
and struck at us with the hilt, until he broke it off and until he
himself was exhausted by loss of breath and of blood. We owe
alike to him the energy of our armies, the bloody scaffolds of
public safety, the Reign of Terror, the empire of usurpation,
and finally, as the calm is successor to the tempest, and sweet
fruit to bitter kernel, the blessing of your majesty&#8217;s restoration.
Excepting in this one event, he was mischievous to our country;
but in all events, and in all undertakings, he was pernicious to
his own. No man ever brought into the world such enduring
evil; few men such extensive.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> His king ordered it. George III loved battles and
blood.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> But he was prudent in his appetite for them.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> He talked of peppering his people as I would talk of
peppering a capon.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> Having split it. His subjects cut up by his
subjects were only capers to his leg of mutton. From none
of his palaces and parks was there any view so rural, so composing
to his spirits, as the shambles. When these were not
fresh, the gibbet would do.</p>

<p>I wish better luck to the pheasants&#8217; eggs than befell Mr. Pitt&#8217;s
designs. Not one brought forth anything.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> No: but he declared in the face of his Parliament, and of
Europe, that he would insist on indemnity for the past and
security for the future. These were his words. Now, all the
money and other wealth the French armies levied in Spain,
Portugal, Italy, and everywhere else, would scarcely be sufficient
for this indemnity.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> England shall never receive from us a tithe of
that amount.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> A tithe of it! She may demand a quarter or a third,
and leave us wondering at her moderation and forbearance.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> The matter must be arranged immediately, before
she has time for calculation or reflection. A new peace maddens
England to the same paroxysm as a new war maddens France.
She hath sent over hither her minister ... or rather her
prime minister himself is come to transact all the business ...
the most ignorant and most shortsighted man to be found in
any station of any public office throughout the whole of Europe.
He must be treated as her arbiter: we must talk to him of restoring
her, of regenerating her, of preserving her, of guiding her,
which (we must protest with our hands within our frills) he
alone is capable of doing. We must enlarge on his generosity
(and generous he indeed is), and there is nothing he will not
concede.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> But if they do not come over in a week, we shall lose
the season. I ought to be eating a pheasant-poult by the middle
of July. Oh, but you were talking to me about the other
matter, and perhaps the weightier of the two; ay, certainly.
If this indemnity is paid to England, what becomes of our
civil list, the dignity of my family and household?</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> I do assure your majesty, England shall never
receive ... did I say a tithe?... I say she shall never
receive a fiftieth of what she expended in the war against us.
It would be out of all reason, and out of all custom in her to
expect it. Indeed it would place her in almost as good a
condition as ourselves. Even if she were beaten she could
hardly hope <i>that</i>: she never in the last three centuries has
demanded it when she was victorious. Of all the sufferers by
the war, we shall be the best off.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> The English are calculators and traders.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> Wild speculators, gamblers in trade, who hazard
more ventures than their books can register. It will take
England some years to cast up the amount of her losses.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> But she, in common with her allies, will insist on
our ceding those provinces which my predecessor Louis XIV
annexed to his kingdom. Be quite certain that nothing short
of Alsace, Lorraine, and Franc Comt&eacute;, will satisfy the German
princes. They must restore the German language in those
provinces: for languages are the only true boundaries of nations,
and there will always be dissension where there is difference of
tongue. We must likewise be prepared to surrender the remainder
of the Netherlands; not indeed to England, who refused
them in the reign of Elizabeth: she wants only Dunkirk, and
Dunkirk she will have.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> This seems reasonable: for which reason it must
never be. Diplomacy, when she yields to such simple arguments
as plain reason urges against her, loses her office, her efficacy,
and her name.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> I would not surrender our conquests in Germany, if
I could help it.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> Nothing more easy. The Emperor Alexander
may be persuaded that Germany united and entire, as she would
then become, must be a dangerous rival to Russia.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> It appears to me that Poland will be more so, with her
free institutions.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> There is only one statesman in the whole number
of those assembled at Paris, who believes that her institutions
will continue free; and he would rather they did not; but he
stipulates for it, to gratify and mystify the people of England.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> I see this clearly. I have a great mind to send Blacas
over to Stowe. I can trust to him to look to the crates and
coops, and to see that the pheasants have enough of air and
water, and that the Governor of Calais finds a commodious
place for them to roost in, forbidding the drums to beat and
disturb them, evening or morning. The next night, according
to my calculation, they repose at Montreuil. I must look at
them before they are let loose. I cannot well imagine why the
public men employed by England are usually, indeed constantly
so inferior in abilities to those of France, Prussia, Austria, and
Russia. What say you, M. Talleyrand? I do not mean about
the pheasants; I mean about the envoys.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> It can only be that I have considered the subject
more frequently and attentively than suited the avocations of
your majesty, that the reason comes out before me clearly and
distinctly. The prime ministers, in all these countries, are
independent, and uncontrolled in the choice of agents. A prime
minister in France may perhaps be willing to promote the
interests of his own family; and hence he may appoint from it
one unworthy of the place. In regard to other families, he
cares little or nothing about them, knowing that his power lies
in the palace, and not in the club-room. Whereas in England he
must conciliate the great families, the hereditary dependants of
his faction, Whig or Tory. Hence even the highest commands
have been conferred on such ignorant and worthless men as the
Duke of York and the Earl of Chatham, although the minister
was fully aware that the honour of his nation was tarnished,
and that its safety was in jeopardy, by such appointments.
Meanwhile he kept his seat however, and fed from it his tame
creatures in the cub.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> Do you apprehend any danger (talking of cubs) that
my pheasants will be bruised against the wooden bars, or suffer
by sea-sickness? I would not command my bishops to offer
up public prayers against such contingencies: for people must
never have positive evidence that the prayers of the Church
can possibly be ineffectual: and we cannot pray for pheasants
as we pray for fine weather, by the barometer. We must drop
it. Now go on with the others, if you have done with England.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> A succession of intelligent men rules Prussia,
Russia, and Austria; because these three are economical, and
must get their bread by creeping, day after day, through the
hedges next to them, and by filching a sheaf or two, early and
late, from cottager or small farmer; that is to say, from free
states and petty princes. Prussia, like a mongrel, would fly
at the legs of Austria and Russia, catching them with the sack
upon their shoulders, unless they untied it and tossed a morsel
to her. These great powers take especial care to impose a
protective duty on intellect; to let none enter the country,
and none leave it, without a passport. Their diplomatists are
as clever and conciliatory as those of England are ignorant and
repulsive, who, while they offer an uncounted sum of secret-service
money with the left hand, give a sounding slap on the
face with the right.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> We, by adopting a contrary policy, gain more information,
raise more respect, inspire more awe, and exercise more
authority. The weightiest of our disbursements are smiles and
flatteries, with a ribbon and a cross at the end of them.</p>

<p>But, between the Duke of York and the Earl of Chatham, I
must confess, I find very little difference.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> Some, however. The one was only drunk all the
evening and all the night; the other was only asleep all the
day. The accumulated fogs of Walcheren seemed to concentrate
in his brain, puffing out at intervals just sufficient
to affect with typhus and blindness four thousand soldiers.
A cake of powder rusted their musket-pans, which they were
too weak to open and wipe. Turning round upon their scanty
and mouldy straw, they beheld their bayonets piled together
against the green dripping wall of the chamber, which neither
bayonet nor soldier was ever to leave again.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> We suffer by the presence of the allied armies in our
capital: but we shall soon be avenged: for the English minister
in another fortnight will return and remain at home.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> England was once so infatuated as to give up
Malta to us, although fifty Gibraltars would be of inferior value
to her. Napoleon laughed at her: she was angry: she began
to suspect she had been duped and befooled: and she broke
her faith.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> For the first time, M. Talleyrand, and with a man
who never had any.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> We shall now induce her to evacuate Sicily, in
violation of her promises to the people of that island. Faith,
having lost her virginity, braves public opinion, and never
blushes more.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> Sicily is the key to India, Egypt is the lock.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> What, if I induce the minister to restore to us
Pondicherry?</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> M. Talleyrand! you have done great things, and
without boasting. Whenever you do boast, let it be that you
will perform only the thing which is possible. The English
know well enough what it is to allow us a near standing-place
anywhere. If they permit a Frenchman to plant one foot in
India, it will upset all Asia before the other touches the ground.
It behoves them to prohibit a single one of us from ever landing
on those shores. Improbable as it is that a man uniting to the
same degree as Hyder-Ali did political and military genius, will
appear in the world again for centuries; most of the princes
are politic, some are brave, and perhaps no few are credulous.
While England is confiding in our loyalty, we might expatiate
on her perfidy, and our tears fall copiously on the broken
sceptre in the dust of Delhi. Ignorant and stupid as the king&#8217;s
ministers may be, the East India Company is well-informed
on its interests, and alert in maintaining them. I wonder that
a republic so wealthy and so wise should be supported on the
bosom of royalty. Believe me, her merchants will take alarm,
and arouse the nation.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> We must do all we have to do, while the nation
is feasting and unsober. It will awaken with sore eyes and
stiff limbs.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> Profuse as the English are, they will never cut the
bottom of their purses.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> They have already done it. Whenever I look
toward the shores of England, I fancy I descry the Dana&iuml;ds
there, toiling at the replenishment of their perforated vases,
and all the Nereids leering and laughing at them in the mischievous
fullness of their hearts.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> Certainly she can do me little harm at present, and
for several years to come: but we must always have an eye
upon her, and be ready to assert our superiority.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> We feel it. In fifty years, by abstaining from
war, we may discharge our debt and replenish our arsenals.
England will never shake off the heavy old man from her
shoulders. Overladen and morose, she will be palsied in the
hand she unremittingly holds up against Ireland. Proud and
perverse, she runs into domestic warfare as blindly as France
runs into foreign: and she refuses to her subject what she
surrenders to her enemy.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> Her whole policy tends to my security.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> We must now consider how your majesty may
enjoy it at home, all the remainder of your reign.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> Indeed you must, M. Talleyrand! Between you and
me be it spoken, I trust but little my loyal people; their loyalty
being so ebullient, that it often overflows the vessel which should
contain it, and is a perquisite of scouts and scullions. I do not
wish to offend you.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> Really I can see no other sure method of containing
and controlling them, than by bastions and redoubts,
the whole circuit of the city.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> M. Talleyrand! I will not doubt your sincerity: I
am confident you have reserved the whole of it for my service;
and there are large arrears. But M. Talleyrand! such an attempt
would be resisted by any people which had ever heard of liberty,
and much more by a people which had ever dreamt of enjoying it.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> Forts are built in all directions above Genoa.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> Yes; by her conqueror, not by her king.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> Your majesty comes with both titles, and rules,
like your great progenitor,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Et par droit de conqu&ecirc;te et par droit de naissance.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Louis.</i> True; my arms have subdued the rebellious; but not
without great firmness and great valour on my part, and some
assistance (however tardy) on the part of my allies. Conquerors
must conciliate: fatherly kings must offer digestible spoon-meat
to their ill-conditioned children. There would be sad
screaming and kicking were I to swaddle mine in stone-work.
No, M. Talleyrand; if ever Paris is surrounded by fortifications
to coerce the populace, it must be the work of some democrat,
some aspirant to supreme power, who resolves to maintain it,
exercising a domination too hazardous for legitimacy. I will
only scrape from the chambers the effervescence of superficial
letters and corrosive law.</p>

<p><i>Talleyrand.</i> Sire! under all their governments the good
people of Paris have submitted to the <i>octroi</i>. Now, all complaints,
physical or political, arise from the stomach. Were it
decorous in a subject to ask a question (however humbly) of his
king, I would beg permission to inquire of your majesty, in your
wisdom, whether a bar across the shoulders is less endurable
than a bar across the palate. Sire! the French can bear anything
now they have the honour of bowing before your majesty.</p>

<p><i>Louis.</i> The compliment is in a slight degree (a <i>very</i> slight
degree) ambiguous, and (accept in good part my criticism,
M. Talleyrand) not turned with your usual grace.</p>

<p>Announce it as my will and pleasure that the Duc de Blacas
do superintend the debarkation of the pheasants; and I pray
God, M. de Talleyrand, to have you in His holy keeping.</p>

<h2><a name="OLIVER_CROMWELL_AND_SIR_OLIVER_CROMWELL" id="OLIVER_CROMWELL_AND_SIR_OLIVER_CROMWELL"></a>OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL</h2>


<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> How many saints and Sions dost carry under thy
cloak, lad? Ay, what dost groan at? What art about to be
delivered of? Troth, it must be a vast and oddly-shapen piece
of roguery which findeth no issue at such capacious quarters.
I never thought to see thy face again. Prithee what, in God&#8217;s
name, hath brought thee to Ramsey, fair Master Oliver?</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> In His name verily I come, and upon His errand;
and the love and duty I bear unto my godfather and uncle have
added wings, in a sort, unto my zeal.</p>

<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> Take &#8217;em off thy zeal and dust thy conscience
with &#8217;em. I have heard an account of a saint, one Phil Neri,
who in the midst of his devotions was lifted up several yards
from the ground. Now I do suspect, Nol, thou wilt finish by
being a saint of his order; and nobody will promise or wish
thee the luck to come down on thy feet again, as he did. So!
because a rabble of fanatics at Huntingdon have equipped thee
as their representative in Parliament, thou art free of all men&#8217;s
houses, forsooth! I would have thee to understand, sirrah,
that thou art fitter for the House they have chaired thee unto
than for mine. Yet I do not question but thou wilt be as
troublesome and unruly there as here. Did I not turn thee out
of Hinchinbrook when thou wert scarcely half the rogue thou art
latterly grown up to? And yet wert thou immeasurably too
big a one for it to hold.</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> It repenteth me, O mine uncle! that in my boyhood
and youth the Lord had not touched me.</p>

<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> Touch thee! thou wast too dirty a dog by half.</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> Yes, sorely doth it vex and harrow me that I was
then of ill conditions, and that my name ... even your
godson&#8217;s ... stank in your nostrils.</p>

<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> Ha! polecat! it was not thy name, although bad
enough, that stank first; in my house, at least. But perhaps
there are worse maggots in stauncher mummeries.</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> Whereas in the bowels of your charity you then
vouchsafed me forgiveness, so the more confidently may I
crave it now in this my urgency.</p>

<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> More confidently! What! hast got more confidence?
Where didst find it? I never thought the wide
circle of the world had within it another jot for thee. Well,
Nol, I see no reason why shouldst stand before me with thy hat
off, in the courtyard and in the sun, counting the stones in the
pavement. Thou hast some knavery in thy head, I warrant
thee. Come, put on thy beaver.</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> Uncle Sir Oliver! I know my duty too well to stand
covered in the presence of so worshipful a kinsman, who, moreover,
hath answered at baptism for my good behaviour.</p>

<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> God forgive me for playing the fool before Him
so presumptuously and unprofitably! Nobody shall ever take
me in again to do such an absurd and wicked thing. But thou
hast some left-handed business in the neighbourhood, no doubt,
or thou wouldst never more have come under my archway.</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> These are hard times for them that seek peace. We
are clay in the hands of the potter.</p>

<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> I wish your potters sought nothing costlier, and
dug in their own grounds for it. Most of us, as thou sayest,
have been upon the wheel of these artificers; and little was left
but rags when we got off. Sanctified folks are the cleverest
skinners in all Christendom, and their Jordan tans and constringes
us to the avoirdupois of mummies.</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> The Lord hath chosen His own vessels.</p>

<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> I wish heartily He would pack them off, and send
them anywhere on ass-back or cart (cart preferably), to rid our
country of &#8217;em. But now again to the point: for if we fall among
the potsherds we shall hobble on but lamely. Since thou art
raised unto a high command in the army, and hast a dragoon
to hold thy solid and stately piece of horse-flesh, I cannot but
take it into my fancy that thou hast some commission of array
or disarray to execute hereabout.</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> With a sad sinking of spirit, to the pitch well-nigh of
swounding, and with a sight of bitter tears, which will not
be put back nor stayed in any wise, as you bear testimony unto
me, Uncle Oliver!</p>

<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> No tears, Master Nol, I beseech thee! Wet
days, among those of thy kidney, portend the letting of blood.
What dost whimper at?</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> That I, that I, of all men living, should be put upon
this work!</p>

<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> What work, prithee?</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> I am sent hither by them who (the Lord in His loving
kindness having pity, and mercy upon these poor realms) do,
under His right hand, administer unto our necessities, and
righteously command us, <i>by the aforesaid as aforesaid</i> (thus
runs the commission), hither am I deputed (woe is me!) to levy
certain fines in this county, or shire, on such as the Parliament
in its wisdom doth style malignants.</p>

<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> If there is anything left about the house, never
be over-nice: dismiss thy modesty and lay hands upon it. In
this county or shire, we let go the civet-bag to save the weazon.</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> O mine uncle and godfather! be witness for me.</p>

<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> Witness for thee! not I indeed. But I would
rather be witness than surety, lad, where thou art docketed.</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> From the most despised doth the Lord ever choose
His servants.</p>

<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> Then, faith! thou art His first butler.</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> Serving Him with humility, I may peradventure be
found worthy of advancement.</p>

<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> Ha! now if any devil speaks from within thee, it
is thy own: he does not snuffle: to my ears he speaks plain English.
Worthy or unworthy of advancement, thou wilt attain it.
Come in; at least for an hour&#8217;s rest. Formerly thou knewest
the means of setting the heaviest heart afloat, let it be sticking
in what mud-bank it might: and my wet dock at Ramsey is
pretty near as commodious as that over yonder at Hinchinbrook
was erewhile. Times are changed, and places too! yet the
cellar holds good.</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> Many and great thanks! But there are certain men
on the other side of the gate, who might take it ill if I turn
away and neglect them.</p>

<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> Let them enter also, or eat their victuals where
they are.</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> They have proud stomachs: they are recusants.</p>

<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> Recusants of what? of beef and ale? We have
claret, I trust, for the squeamish, if they are above the condition
of tradespeople. But of course you leave no person of higher
quality in the outer court.</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> Vain are they and worldly, although such wickedness
is the most abominable in their cases. Idle folks are fond of
sitting in the sun: I would not forbid them this indulgence.</p>

<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> But who are they?</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> The Lord knows. Maybe priests, deacons, and such-like.</p>

<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> Then, sir, they are gentlemen. And the commission
you bear from the parliamentary thieves, to sack and pillage
my mansion-house, is far less vexatious and insulting to me,
than your behaviour in keeping them so long at my stable-door.
With your permission, or without it, I shall take the
liberty to invite them to partake of my poor hospitality.</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> But, Uncle Sir Oliver! there are rules and ordinances
whereby it must be manifested that they lie under displeasure
... not mine ... not mine ... but my milk must not
flow for them.</p>

<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> You may enter the house or remain where you are,
at your option; I make my visit to these gentlemen immediately,
for I am tired of standing. If thou ever reachest my age,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Oliver! (but God will not surely let this be) thou wilt know that
the legs become at last of doubtful fidelity in the service of the
body.</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> Uncle Sir Oliver! now that, as it seemeth, you have
been taking a survey of the courtyard and its contents, am I
indiscreet in asking your worship whether I acted not prudently
in keeping the <i>men-at-belly</i> under the custody of the <i>men-at-arms</i>?
This pestilence, like unto one I remember to have read
about in some poetry of Master Chapman&#8217;s,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> began with the
dogs and mules, and afterwards crope up into the breasts
of men.</p>

<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> I call such treatment barbarous; their troopers
will not let the gentlemen come with me into the house, but
insist on sitting down to dinner with them. And yet, having
brought them out of their colleges, these brutal half-soldiers
must know that they are fellows.</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> Yea, of a truth are they, and fellows well met. Out
of their superfluities they give nothing to the Lord or His saints;
no, not even stirrup or girth, wherewith we may mount our
horses and go forth against those who thirst for our blood.
Their eyes are fat, and they raise not up their voices to cry for
our deliverance.</p>

<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> Art mad? What stirrups and girths are hung up
in college halls and libraries? For what are these gentlemen
brought hither?</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> They have elected me, with somewhat short of
unanimity, not indeed to be one of themselves, for of that
distinction I acknowledge and deplore my unworthiness, nor
indeed to be a poor scholar, to which, unless it be a very poor
one, I have almost as small pretension, but simply to undertake
a while the heavier office of bursar for them; to cast up their
accounts; to overlook the scouring of their plate; and to lay a
list thereof, with a few specimens, before those who fight the
fight of the Lord, that His saints, seeing the abasement of the
proud and the chastisement of worldly-mindedness, may rejoice.</p>

<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> I am grown accustomed to such saints and such
rejoicings. But, little could I have thought, threescore years
ago, that the hearty and jovial people of England would ever
join in so filching and stabbing a jocularity. Even the petticoated
torchbearers from rotten Rome, who lighted the faggots
in Smithfield some years before, if more blustering and cocksy,
were less bitter and vulturine. They were all intolerant, but
they were not all hypocritical; they had not always &#8216;<i>the Lord</i>&#8217;
in their mouth.</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> According to their own notions, they might have had,
at an outlay of a farthing.</p>

<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> Art facetious, Nol? for it is as hard to find that
out as anything else in thee, only it makes thee look, at times,
a little the grimmer and sourer.</p>

<p>But, regarding these gentlemen from Cambridge. Not being
such as, by their habits and professions, could have opposed you
in the field, I hold it unmilitary and unmanly to put them under
any restraint, and to lead them away from their peaceful and
useful occupations.</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> I always bow submissively before the judgment of
mine elders; and the more reverentially when I know them to
be endowed with greater wisdom, and guided by surer experience
than myself. Alas! these collegians not only are strong
men, as you may readily see if you measure them round the
waistband, but boisterous and pertinacious challengers. When
we, who live in the fear of God, exhorted them earnestly unto
peace and brotherly love, they held us in derision. Thus far
indeed it might be an advantage to us, teaching us forbearance
and self-seeking, but we cannot countenance the evil spirit
moving them thereunto. Their occupations, as you remark
most wisely, might have been useful and peaceful, and had
formerly been so. Why then did they gird the sword of strife
about their loins against the children of Israel? By their own
declaration, not only are they our enemies, but enemies the
most spiteful and untractable. When I came quietly, lawfully,
and in the name of the Lord, for their plate, what did they?
Instead of surrendering it like honest and conscientious men,
they attacked me and my people on horseback, with syllogisms
and enthymemes, and the Lord knows with what other such
gimcracks; such venomous and rankling old weapons as those
who have the fear of God before their eyes are fain to lay aside.
Learning should not make folks mockers ... should not make
folks malignants ... should not harden their hearts. We
came with bowels for them.</p>

<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> That ye did! and bowels which would have stowed
within them all the plate on board of a galleon. If tankards
and wassail-bowls had stuck between your teeth, you would not
have felt them.</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> We did feel them; some at least: perhaps we missed
too many.</p>

<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> How can these learned societies raise the money
you exact from them, beside plate? dost think they can create
and coin it?</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> In Cambridge, Uncle Sir Oliver, and more especially
in that college named in honour (as they profanely call it) of
the Blessed Trinity, there are great conjurors or chemists. Now
the said conjurors or chemists not only do possess the faculty
of making the precious metals out of old books and parchments,
but out of the skulls of young lordlings and gentlefolks, which
verily promise less. And this they bring about by certain
gold wires fastened at the top of certain caps. Of said metals,
thus devilishly converted, do they make a vain and sumptuous
use; so that, finally, they are afraid of cutting their lips with
glass. But indeed it is high time to call them.</p>

<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> Well ... at last thou hast some mercy.</p>

<p><i>Oliver.</i> [<i>Aloud.</i>] Cuffsatan Ramsbottom! Sadsoul Kiteclaw!
advance! Let every gown, together with the belly that is
therein, mount up behind you and your comrades in good fellowship.
And forasmuch as you at the country places look to bit
and bridle, it seemeth fair and equitable that ye should leave
unto them, in full propriety, the mancipular office of discharging
the account. If there be any spare beds at the inns, allow the
doctors and dons to occupy the same ... they being used to
lie softly; and be not urgent that more than three lie in
each ... they being mostly corpulent. Let pass quietly and
unreproved any light bubble of pride or impetuosity, seeing
that they have not always been accustomed to the service of
guards and ushers. The Lord be with ye!... Slow trot!
And now, Uncle Sir Oliver, I can resist no longer your loving
kindness. I kiss you, my godfather, in heart&#8217;s and soul&#8217;s duty;
and most humbly and gratefully do I accept of your invitation
to dine and lodge with you, albeit the least worthy of your
family and kinsfolk. After the refreshment of needful food,
more needful prayer, and that sleep which descendeth on the
innocent like the dew of Hermon, to-morrow at daybreak I
proceed on my journey Londonward.</p>

<p><i>Sir Oliver.</i> [<i>Aloud.</i>] Ho, there! [<i>To a servant.</i>] Let dinner be
prepared in the great dining-room; let every servant be in waiting,
each in full livery; let every delicacy the house affords be
placed upon the table in due courses; arrange all the plate upon
the sideboard: a gentleman by descent ... a stranger ...
has claimed my hospitality. [<i>Servant goes.</i>]</p>

<p>Sir! you are now master. Grant me dispensation, I entreat
you, from a further attendance on you.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> Ludolph! my beloved Ludolph! do we meet again?
Ah! I am jealous of these little ones, and of the embraces you
are giving them.</p>

<p>Why sigh, my sweet husband?</p>

<p>Come back again, Wilhelm! Come back again, Annabella!
How could you run away? Do you think you can see better
out of the corner?</p>

<p><i>Annabella.</i> Is this indeed our papa? What, in the name
of mercy, can have given him so dark a colour? I hope I shall
never be like that; and yet everybody tells me I am very like
papa.</p>

<p><i>Wilhelm.</i> Do not let her plague you, papa; but take me
between your knees (I am too old to sit upon them), and tell me
all about the Turks, and how you ran away from them.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> Wilhelm! if your father had run away from the
enemy, we should not have been deprived of him two whole
years.</p>

<p><i>Wilhelm.</i> I am hardly such a child as to suppose that a
Christian knight would run away from a rebel Turk in battle.
But even Christians are taken, somehow, by their tricks and
contrivances, and their dog Mahomet. Beside, you know you
yourself told me, with tear after tear, and scolding me for mine,
that papa was taken by them.</p>

<p><i>Annabella.</i> Neither am I, who am only one year younger, so
foolish as to believe there is any dog Mahomet. And, if there
were, we have dogs that are better and faithfuller and stronger.</p>

<p><i>Wilhelm.</i> [<i>To his father.</i>] I can hardly help laughing to think
what curious fancies girls have about Mahomet. We know that
Mahomet is a dog-spirit with three horsetails.</p>

<p><i>Annabella.</i> Papa! I am glad to see you smile at Wilhelm.
I do assure you he is not half so bad a boy as he was, although
he did point at me, and did tell you some mischief.</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> I ought to be indeed most happy at seeing you all
again.</p>

<p><i>Annabella.</i> And so you are. Don&#8217;t pretend to look grave now.
I very easily find you out. I often look grave when I am the
happiest. But forth it bursts at last: there is no room for it
in tongue, or eyes, or anywhere.</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> And so, my little angel, you begin to recollect me.</p>

<p><i>Annabella.</i> At first I used to dream of papa, but at last I
forgot how to dream of him: and then I cried, but at last I left
off crying. And then, papa, who could come to me in my
sleep, seldom came again.</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> Why do you now draw back from me, Annabella?</p>

<p><i>Annabella.</i> Because you really are so very very brown: just
like those ugly Turks who sawed the pines in the saw-pit under
the wood, and who refused to drink wine in the heat of summer,
when Wilhelm and I brought it to them. Do not be angry;
we did it only once.</p>

<p><i>Wilhelm.</i> Because one of them stamped and frightened her
when the other seemed to bless us.</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> Are they still living?</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> One of them is.</p>

<p><i>Wilhelm.</i> The fierce one.</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> We will set him free, and wish it were the other.</p>

<p><i>Annabella.</i> Papa! I am glad you are come back without
your spurs.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> Hush, child, hush.</p>

<p><i>Annabella.</i> Why, mamma? Do not you remember how
they tore my frock when I clung to him at parting? Now I
begin to think of him again: I lose everything between that
day and this.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> The girl&#8217;s idle prattle about the spurs has pained
you: always too sensitive; always soon hurt, though never soon
offended.</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> O God! O my children! O my wife! it is not the
loss of spurs I now must blush for.</p>

<p><i>Annabella.</i> Indeed, papa, you never can blush at all, until
you cut that horrid beard off.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> Well may you say, my own Ludolph, as you do;
for most gallant was your bearing in the battle.</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> Ah! why was it ever fought?</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> Why were most battles? But they may lead to
glory even through slavery.</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> And to shame and sorrow.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> Have I lost the little beauty I possessed, that you
hold my hand so languidly, and turn away your eyes when they
meet mine? It was not so formerly ... unless when first
we loved.</p>

<p>That one kiss restores to me all my lost happiness.</p>

<p>Come; the table is ready: there are your old wines upon it:
you must want that refreshment.</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> Go, my sweet children! you must eat your supper
before I do.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> Run into your own room for it.</p>

<p><i>Annabella.</i> I will not go until papa has patted me again on the
shoulder, now I begin to remember it. I do not much mind the
beard: I grow used to it already: but indeed I liked better to
stroke and pat the smooth laughing cheek, with my arm across
the neck behind. It is very pleasant even so. Am I not grown?
I can put the whole length of my finger between your lips.</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> And now, will not <i>you</i> come, Wilhelm?</p>

<p><i>Wilhelm.</i> I am too tall and too heavy: she is but a child.
[<i>Whispers.</i>] Yet I think, papa, I am hardly so much of a man
but you may kiss me over again ... if you will not let her see it.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> My dears! why do not you go to your supper?</p>

<p><i>Annabella.</i> Because he has come to show us what Turks
are like.</p>

<p><i>Wilhelm.</i> Do not be angry with her. Do not look down, papa!</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> Blessings on you both, sweet children!</p>

<p><i>Wilhelm.</i> We may go now.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> And now, Ludolph, come to the table, and tell me
all your sufferings.</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> The worst begin here.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> Ungrateful Ludolph!</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> I am he: that is my name in full.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> You have then ceased to love me?</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> Worse; if worse can be: I have ceased to deserve
your love.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> No: Ludolph hath spoken falsely for once; but
Ludolph is not false.</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> I have forfeited all I ever could boast of, your affection
and my own esteem. Away with caresses! Repulse me,
abjure me; hate, and never pardon me. Let the abject heart
lie untorn by one remorse. Forgiveness would split and shiver
what slavery but abased.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> Again you embrace me; and yet tell me never to
pardon you! O inconsiderate man! O idle deviser of impossible
things!</p>

<p>But you have not introduced to me those who purchased your
freedom, or who achieved it by their valour.</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> Mercy! O God!</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> Are they dead? Was the plague abroad.</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> I will not dissemble ... such was never my intention
... that my deliverance was brought about by means of&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> Say it at once ... a lady.</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> It was.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> She fled with you.</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> She did.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> And have you left her, sir?</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> Alas! alas! I have not; and never can.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> Now come to my arms, brave, honourable Ludolph!
Did I not say thou couldst not be ungrateful? Where, where
is she who has given me back my husband?</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> Dare I utter it! in this house.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> Call the children.</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> No; they must not affront her: they must not even
stare at her: other eyes, not theirs, must stab me to the heart.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> They shall bless her; we will all. Bring her in.</p>

<p>[<i>Zaida is led in by the Count.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> We three have stood silent long enough: and much
there may be on which we will for ever keep silence. But,
sweet young creature! can I refuse my protection, or my love,
to the preserver of my husband? Can I think it a crime, or
even a folly, to have pitied the brave and the unfortunate?
to have pressed (but alas! that it ever should have been so here!)
a generous heart to a tender one?</p>

<p>Why do you begin to weep?</p>

<p><i>Zaida.</i> Under your kindness, O lady, lie the sources of these
tears.</p>

<p>But why has he left us? He might help me to say many things
which I want to say.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> Did he never tell you he was married?</p>

<p><i>Zaida.</i> He did indeed.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> That he had children?</p>

<p><i>Zaida.</i> It comforted me a little to hear it.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> Why? prithee why?</p>

<p><i>Zaida.</i> When I was in grief at the certainty of holding but
the second place in his bosom, I thought I could at least go and
play with them, and win perhaps their love.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> According to our religion, a man must have only
one wife.</p>

<p><i>Zaida.</i> That troubled me again. But the dispenser of your
religion, who binds and unbinds, does for sequins or services
what our Prophet does purely through kindness.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> We can love but one.</p>

<p><i>Zaida.</i> We indeed can love only one: but men have large
hearts.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> Unhappy girl!</p>

<p><i>Zaida.</i> The very happiest in the world.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> Ah! inexperienced creature!</p>

<p><i>Zaida.</i> The happier for that perhaps.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> But the sin!</p>

<p><i>Zaida.</i> Where sin is, there must be sorrow: and I, my sweet
sister, feel none whatever. Even when tears fall from my eyes,
they fall only to cool my breast: I would not have one the fewer:
they all are for him: whatever he does, whatever he causes, is
dear to me.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] This is too much. I could hardly endure
to have him so beloved by another, even at the extremity of
the earth. [<i>To Zaida.</i>] You would not lead him into perdition?</p>

<p><i>Zaida.</i> I have led him (Allah be praised!) to his wife and
children. It was for those I left my father. He whom we love
might have stayed with me at home: but there he would have
been only half happy, even had he been free. I could not often
let him see me through the lattice; I was too afraid; and I dared
only once let fall the water-melon; it made such a noise in
dropping and rolling on the terrace: but, another day, when
I had pared it nicely, and had swathed it up well among vine-leaves,
dipped in sugar and sherbet, I was quite happy. I
leaped and danced to have been so ingenious. I wonder what
creature could have found and eaten it. I wish he were here,
that I might ask him if he knew.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> He quite forgot home then!</p>

<p><i>Zaida.</i> When we could speak together at all, he spoke perpetually
of those whom the calamity of war had separated from
him.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> It appears that you could comfort him in his distress,
and did it willingly.</p>

<p><i>Zaida.</i> It is delightful to kiss the eye-lashes of the beloved: is
it not? but never so delightful as when fresh tears are on them.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> And even this too? you did this?</p>

<p><i>Zaida.</i> Fifty times.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> Insupportable!</p>

<p>He often then spoke about me?</p>

<p><i>Zaida.</i> As sure as ever we met: for he knew I loved him the
better when I heard him speak so fondly.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> [<i>To herself.</i>] Is this possible? It may be ... of
the absent, the unknown, the unfeared, the unsuspected.</p>

<p><i>Zaida.</i> We shall now be so happy, all three.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> How can we all live together?</p>

<p><i>Zaida.</i> Now he is here, is there no bond of union?</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> Of union? of union? [<i>Aside</i>.] Slavery is a frightful
thing! slavery for life, too! And she released him from it.
What then? Impossible! impossible! [<i>To Zaida.</i>] We are
rich....</p>

<p><i>Zaida.</i> I am glad to hear it. Nothing anywhere goes on
well without riches.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> We can provide for you amply....</p>

<p><i>Zaida.</i> Our husband....</p>

<p><i>Countess. Our!... husband!...</i></p>

<p><i>Zaida.</i> Yes, yes; I know he is yours too; and you, being the
elder and having children, are lady above all. He can tell you
how little I want: a bath, a slave, a dish of pilau, one jonquil
every morning, as usual; nothing more. But he must swear
that he has kissed it first. No, he need not swear it; I may
always see him do it, now.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] She agonizes me. [<i>To Zaida.</i>] Will you
never be induced to return to your own country? Could not
Ludolph persuade you?</p>

<p><i>Zaida.</i> He who could once persuade me anything, may now
command me everything: when he says I must go, I go. But
he knows what awaits me.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> No, child! he never shall say it.</p>

<p><i>Zaida.</i> Thanks, lady! eternal thanks! The breaking of his
word would break my heart; and better <i>that</i> break first. Let
the command come from you, and not from him.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> [<i>Calling aloud.</i>] Ludolph! Ludolph! hither! Kiss
the hand I present to you, and never forget it is the hand of a
preserver.</p>

<h4><a name="FIRST_DAYS_INTERVIEW" id="FIRST_DAYS_INTERVIEW"></a>FIRST DAY&#8217;S INTERVIEW</h4>


<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Who is he that entered, and now steps so silently
and softly, yet with a foot so heavy it shakes my curtains?</p>

<p>Frate Biagio! can it possibly be you?</p>

<p>No more physic for me, nor masses neither, at present.</p>

<p>Assunta! Assuntina! who is it?</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> I cannot say, Signor Padrone! he puts his finger
in the dimple of his chin, and smiles to make me hold my tongue.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Fra Biagio! are you come from Samminiato for
this? You need not put your finger there. We want no secrets.
The girl knows her duty and does her business. I have slept
well, and wake better. [<i>Raising himself up a little.</i>]</p>

<p>Why? who are you? It makes my eyes ache to look aslant
over the sheets; and I cannot get to sit quite upright so
conveniently; and I must not have the window-shutters opened,
they tell me.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Dear Giovanni! have you then been very unwell?</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> O that sweet voice! and this fat friendly hand of
thine, Francesco!</p>

<p>Thou hast distilled all the pleasantest flowers, and all the
wholesomest herbs of spring, into my breast already.</p>

<p>What showers we have had this April, ay! How could you
come along such roads? If the devil were my labourer, I would
make him work upon these of Certaldo. He would have little
time and little itch for mischief ere he had finished them, but
would gladly fan himself with an Agnus-castus, and go to sleep
all through the carnival.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Let us cease to talk both of the labour and the
labourer. You have then been dangerously ill?</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> I do not know: they told me I was: and truly a
man might be unwell enough, who has twenty masses said for
him, and fain sigh when he thinks what he has paid for them.
As I hope to be saved, they cost me a lira each. Assunta is a
good market-girl in eggs, and mutton, and cow-heel; but I
would not allow her to argue and haggle about the masses.
Indeed she knows best whether they were not fairly worth all
that was asked for them, although I could have bought a winter
cloak for less money. However, we do not want both at the
same time. I did not want the cloak: I wanted <i>them</i>, it seems.
And yet I begin to think God would have had mercy on me, if I
had begged it of him myself in my own house. What think you?</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> I think he might.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Particularly if I offered him the sacrifice on which
I wrote to you.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> That letter has brought me hither.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> You do then insist on my fulfilling my promise,
the moment I can leave my bed. I am ready and willing.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Promise! none was made. You only told me that,
if it pleased God to restore you to your health again, you are
ready to acknowledge His mercy by the holocaust of your
<i>Decameron</i>. What proof have you that God would exact it?
If you could destroy the <i>Inferno</i> of Dante, would you?</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Not I, upon my life! I would not promise to burn
a copy of it on the condition of a recovery for twenty years.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> You are the only author who would not rather
demolish another&#8217;s work than his own; especially if he thought
it better: a thought which seldom goes beyond suspicion.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> I am not jealous of any one: I think admiration
pleasanter. Moreover, Dante and I did not come forward at
the same time, nor take the same walks. His flames are too
fierce for you and me: we had trouble enough with milder. I
never felt any high gratification in hearing of people being
damned; and much less would I toss them into the fire myself.
I might indeed have put a nettle under the nose of the learned
judge in Florence, when he banished you and your family;
but I hardly think I could have voted for more than a scourging
to the foulest and fiercest of the party.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Be as compassionate, be as amiably irresolute,
toward your own <i>Novelle</i>, which have injured no friend of yours,
and deserve more affection.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Francesco! no character I ever knew, ever heard
of, or ever feigned, deserves the same affection as you do;
the tenderest lover, the truest friend, the firmest patriot, and,
rarest of glories! the poet who cherishes another&#8217;s fame as dearly
as his own.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> If aught of this is true, let it be recorded of me
that my exhortations and entreaties have been successful, in
preserving the works of the most imaginative and creative
genius that our Italy, or indeed our world, hath in any age beheld.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> I would not destroy his poems, as I told you, or
think I told you. Even the worst of the Florentines, who in
general keep only one of God&#8217;s commandments, keep it rigidly
in regard to Dante&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Love them who curse you.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p>He called them all scoundrels, with somewhat less courtesy
than cordiality, and less afraid of censure for veracity than
adulation: he sent their fathers to hell, with no inclination
to separate the child and parent: and now they are hugging
him for it in his shroud! Would you ever have suspected them
of being such lovers of justice?</p>

<p>You must have mistaken my meaning; the thought never
entered my head: the idea of destroying a single copy of Dante!
And what effect would that produce? There must be fifty,
or near it, in various parts of Italy.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> I spoke of you.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Of me! My poetry is vile; I have already thrown
into the fire all of it within my reach.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Poetry was not the question. We neither of us
are such poets as we thought ourselves when we were younger,
and as younger men think us still. I meant your <i>Decameron</i>;
in which there is more character, more nature, more invention,
than either modern or ancient Italy, or than Greece, from whom
she derived her whole inheritance, ever claimed or ever knew.
Would you consume a beautiful meadow because there are
reptiles in it; or because a few grubs hereafter may be generated
by the succulence of the grass?</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> You amaze me: you utterly confound me.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> If you would eradicate twelve or thirteen of the
<i>Novelle</i>, and insert the same number of better, which you could
easily do within as many weeks, I should be heartily glad to see
it done. Little more than a tenth of the <i>Decameron</i> is bad:
less than a twentieth of the <i>Divina Commedia</i> is good.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> So little?</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Let me never seem irreverent to our master.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Speak plainly and fearlessly, Francesco! Malice
and detraction are strangers to you.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Well then: at least sixteen parts in twenty of the
<i>Inferno</i> and <i>Purgatorio</i> are detestable, both in poetry and
principle: the higher parts are excellent indeed.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> I have been reading the <i>Paradiso</i> more recently.
Here it is, under the pillow. It brings me happier dreams
than the others, and takes no more time in bringing them.
Preparation for my lectures made me remember a great deal of
the poem. I did not request my auditors to admire the beauty
of the metrical version:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Osanna sanctus deus Sabbaoth,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Super-illustrans charitate tu&acirc;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Felices ignes horum Malahoth,</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p>nor these, with a slip of Italian between two pales of Latin:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Modicum,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> et non videbitis me,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Et iterum, sorelle mie dilette,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Modicum, et vos videbitis me.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p>I dare not repeat all I recollect of</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Pepe Setan, Pepe Setan, aleppe,</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p>as there is no holy-water-sprinkler in the room: and you are
aware that other dangers awaited me, had I been so imprudent
as to show the Florentines the allusion of our poet. His <i>gergo</i> is
perpetually in play, and sometimes plays very roughly.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> We will talk again of him presently. I must now
rejoice with you over the recovery and safety of your prodigal
son, the <i>Decameron</i>.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> So then, you would preserve at any rate my
favourite volume from the threatened conflagration.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Had I lived at the time of Dante, I would have
given him the same advice in the same circumstances. Yet how
different is the tendency of the two productions! Yours is
somewhat too licentious; and young men, in whose nature, or
rather in whose education and habits, there is usually this failing,
will read you with more pleasure than is commendable or
innocent. Yet the very time they occupy with you, would
perhaps be spent in the midst of those excesses or irregularities,
to which the moralist, in his utmost severity, will argue that
your pen directs them. Now there are many who are fond of
standing on the brink of precipices, and who nevertheless are
as cautious as any of falling in. And there are minds desirous
of being warmed by description, which without this warmth
might seek excitement among the things described.</p>

<p>I would not tell you in health what I tell you in convalescence,
nor urge you to compose what I dissuade you from cancelling.
After this avowal, I do declare to you, Giovanni, that in my
opinion, the very idlest of your tales will do the world as much
good as evil; not reckoning the pleasure of reading, nor the
exercise and recreation of the mind, which in themselves are
good. What I reprove you for, is the indecorous and uncleanly;
and these, I trust, you will abolish. Even these, however, may
repel from vice the ingenuous and graceful spirit, and can never
lead any such toward them. Never have you taken an inhuman
pleasure in blunting and fusing the affections at the furnace of
the passions; never, in hardening by sour sagacity and ungenial
strictures, that delicacy which is more productive of innocence
and happiness, more estranged from every track and tendency
of their opposites, than what in cold, crude systems hath holden
the place and dignity of the highest virtue. May you live,
O my friend, in the enjoyment of health, to substitute the
facetious for the licentious, the simple for the extravagant, the
true and characteristic for the indefinite and diffuse.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> And after all this, can you bear to think what
I am?</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Complacently and joyfully; venturing, nevertheless,
to offer you a friend&#8217;s advice.</p>

<p>Enter into the mind and heart of your own creatures: think
of them long, entirely, solely: never of style, never of self, never
of critics, cracked or sound. Like the miles of an open country,
and of an ignorant population, when they are correctly measured
they become smaller. In the loftiest rooms and richest entablatures
are suspended the most spider-webs; and the quarry out
of which palaces are erected is the nursery of nettle and bramble.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> It is better to keep always in view such writers
as Cicero, than to run after those idlers who throw stones that
can never reach us.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> If you copied him to perfection, and on no occasion
lost sight of him, you would be an indifferent, not to say a bad
writer.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> I begin to think you are in the right. Well then,
retrenching some of my licentious tales, I must endeavour to
fill up the vacancy with some serious and some pathetic.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> I am heartily glad to hear of this decision; for,
admirable as you are in the jocose, you descend from your
natural position when you come to the convivial and the festive.
You were placed among the Affections, to move and master
them, and gifted with the rod that sweetens the fount of tears.
My nature leads me also to the pathetic; in which, however,
an imbecile writer may obtain celebrity. Even the hard-hearted
are fond of such reading, when they are fond of any;
and nothing is easier in the world than to find and accumulate
its sufferings. Yet this very profusion and luxuriance of misery
is the reason why few have excelled in describing it. The eye
wanders over the mass without noticing the peculiarities. To
mark them distinctly is the work of genius; a work so rarely
performed, that, if time and space may be compared, specimens
of it stand at wider distances than the trophies of Sesostris.
Here we return again to the <i>Inferno</i> of Dante, who overcame the
difficulty. In this vast desert are its greater and its less oasis;
Ugolino and Francesca di Rimini. The peopled region is
peopled chiefly with monsters and moschitoes: the rest for the
most part is sand and suffocation.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Ah! had Dante remained through life the pure
solitary lover of Bice, his soul had been gentler, tranquiller, and
more generous. He scarcely hath described half the curses
he went through, nor the roads he took on the journey: theology,
politics, and that barbican of the <i>Inferno</i>, marriage, surrounded
with its</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Selva selvaggia ed aspra e forte.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p>Admirable is indeed the description of Ugolino, to whoever can
endure the sight of an old soldier gnawing at the scalp of an old
archbishop.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> The thirty lines from</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ed io sentii,</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p>are unequalled by any other continuous thirty in the whole
dominions of poetry.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Give me rather the six on Francesca: for if in the
former I find the simple, vigorous, clear narration, I find also
what I would not wish, the features of Ugolino reflected full in
Dante. The two characters are similar in themselves; hard,
cruel, inflexible, malignant, but, whenever moved, moved
powerfully. In Francesca, with the faculty of divine spirits,
he leaves his own nature (not indeed the exact representative
of theirs) and converts all his strength into tenderness. The great
poet, like the original man of the Platonists, is double, possessing
the further advantage of being able to drop one half at his
option, and to resume it. Some of the tenderest on paper
have no sympathies beyond; and some of the austerest in their
intercourse with their fellow-creatures have deluged the world
with tears. It is not from the rose that the bee gathers her
honey, but often from the most acrid and the most bitter leaves
and petals:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quando leggemmo il disiato viso</span><br />
<span class="i1">Esser baciato di cotanto amante,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Questi, chi mai da me non sia diviso!</span><br />
<span class="i1">La bocca mi baci&ograve; tutto tremante ...</span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>Galeotto</i> f&ugrave; il libro, e chi lo scrisse ...</span><br />
<span class="i1">Quel giorno pi&ugrave; non vi leggemmo avante.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p>In the midst of her punishment, Francesca, when she comes to
the tenderest part of her story, tells it with complacency and
delight; and, instead of naming Paolo, which indeed she never
has done from the beginning, she now designates him as</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Questi chi mai da me non sia diviso!</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p>Are we not impelled to join in her prayer, wishing them happier
in their union?</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> If there be no sin in it.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Ay, and even if there be ... God help us!</p>

<p>What a sweet aspiration in each cesura of the verse! three
love-sighs fixed and incorporate! Then, when she hath said</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">La bocca mi baci&ograve;, tutto tremante,</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p>she stops: she would avert the eyes of Dante from her: he
looks for the sequel: she thinks he looks severely: she says:
&#8216;<i>Galeotto</i> is the name of the book,&#8217; fancying by this timorous
little flight she has drawn him far enough from the nest of her
young loves. No, the eagle beak of Dante and his piercing eyes
are yet over her.</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>Galeotto</i> is the name of the book.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What matters that?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And of the writer.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Or that either?&#8217;</p>

<p>At last she disarms him: but how?</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>That</i> day we read no more.&#8217;</p>

<p>Such a depth of intuitive judgment, such a delicacy of
perception, exists not in any other work of human genius; and
from an author who, on almost all occasions, in this part of
the work, betrays a deplorable want of it.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Perfection of poetry! The greater is my wonder at
discovering nothing else of the same order or cast in this whole
section of the poem. He who fainted at the recital of Francesca,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And he who fell as a dead body falls,</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p>would exterminate all the inhabitants of every town in Italy!
What execrations against Florence, Pistoia, Siena, Pisa, Genoa!
what hatred against the whole human race! what exultation
and merriment at eternal and immitigable sufferings! Seeing
this, I cannot but consider the <i>Inferno</i> as the most immoral
and impious book that ever was written. Yet, hopeless that our
country shall ever see again such poetry, and certain that without
it our future poets would be more feebly urged forward to
excellence, I would have dissuaded Dante from cancelling it,
if this had been his intention. Much however as I admire his
vigour and severity of style in the description of Ugolino, I
acknowledge with you that I do not discover so much imagination,
so much creative power, as in the Francesca. I find indeed
a minute detail of probable events: but this is not all I want
in a poet: it is not even all I want most in a scene of horror.
Tribunals of justice, dens of murderers, wards of hospitals,
schools of anatomy, will afford us nearly the same sensations,
if we hear them from an accurate observer, a clear reporter, a
skilful surgeon, or an attentive nurse. There is nothing of
sublimity in the horrific of Dante, which there always is in
Aeschylus and Homer. If you, Giovanni, had described so
nakedly the reception of Guiscardo&#8217;s heart by Gismonda, or
Lorenzo&#8217;s head by Lisabetta, we could hardly have endured it.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Prithee, dear Francesco, do not place me over
Dante: I stagger at the idea of approaching him.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Never think I am placing you blindly or indiscriminately.
I have faults to find with you, and even here.
Lisabetta should by no means have been represented cutting
off the head of her lover, &#8216;<i>as well as she could</i>,&#8217; with a clasp-knife.
This is shocking and improbable. She might have found
it already cut off by her brothers, in order to bury the corpse
more commodiously and expeditiously. Nor indeed is it likely
that she should have entrusted it to her waiting-maid, who carried
home in her bosom a treasure so dear to her, and found so
unexpectedly and so lately.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> That is true: I will correct the oversight. Why do
we never hear of our faults until everybody knows them, and
until they stand in record against us?</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Because our ears are closed to truth and friendship
for some time after the triumphal course of composition. We
are too sensitive for the gentlest touch; and when we really
have the most infirmity, we are angry to be told that we
have any.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Ah, Francesco! thou art poet from scalp to heel:
but what other would open his breast as thou hast done! They
show ostentatiously far worse weaknesses; but the most honest
of the tribe would forswear himself on this. Again, I acknowledge
it, you have reason to complain of Lisabetta and Gismonda.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> In my delight to listen to you after so long an
absence, I have been too unwary; and you have been speaking
too much for one infirm. Greatly am I to blame, not to have
moderated my pleasure and your vivacity. You must rest now:
to-morrow we will renew our conversation.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> God bless thee, Francesco! I shall be talking
with thee all night in my slumbers. Never have I seen thee
with such pleasure as to-day, excepting when I was deemed
worthy by our fellow-citizens of bearing to thee, and of placing
within this dear hand of thine, the sentence of recall from
banishment, and when my tears streamed over the ordinance
as I read it, whereby thy paternal lands were redeemed from
the public treasury.</p>

<p>Again God bless thee! Those tears were not quite exhausted:
take the last of them.</p>

<h4><a name="THIRD_DAYS_INTERVIEW" id="THIRD_DAYS_INTERVIEW"></a>THIRD DAY&#8217;S INTERVIEW</h4>

<p>It being now the Lord&#8217;s day, Messer Francesco thought it meet
that he should rise early in the morning and bestir himself, to
hear mass in the parish church at Certaldo. Whereupon he
went on tiptoe, if so weighty a man could indeed go in such a
fashion, and lifted softly the latch of Ser Giovanni&#8217;s chamber
door, that he might salute him ere he departed, and occasion
no wonder at the step he was about to take. He found Ser
Giovanni fast asleep, with the missal wide open across his nose,
and a pleasant smile on his genial, joyous mouth. Ser Francesco
leaned over the couch, closed his hands together, and looking
with even more than his usual benignity, said in a low voice:</p>

<p>&#8216;God bless thee, gentle soul! the mother of purity and innocence
protect thee!&#8217;</p>

<p>He then went into the kitchen, where he found the girl
Assunta, and mentioned his resolution. She informed him that
the horse had eaten his two beans,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and was as strong as a lion
and as ready as a lover. Ser Francesco patted her on the
cheek, and called her <i>semplicetta</i>! She was overjoyed at this
honour from so great a man, the bosom friend of her good master,
whom she had always thought the greatest man in the world,
not excepting Monsignore, until he told her he was only a
dog confronted with Ser Francesco. She tripped alertly across
the paved court into the stable, and took down the saddle
and bridle from the farther end of the rack. But Ser Francesco,
with his natural politeness, would not allow her to equip his
palfrey.</p>

<p>&#8216;This is not the work for maidens,&#8217; said he; &#8216;return to the
house, good girl!&#8217;</p>

<p>She lingered a moment, then went away; but, mistrusting
the dexterity of Ser Francesco, she stopped and turned back
again, and peeped through the half-closed door, and heard
sundry sobs and wheezes round about the girth. Ser Francesco&#8217;s
wind ill seconded his intention; and, although he had
thrown the saddle valiantly and stoutly in its station, yet the
girths brought him into extremity. She entered again, and
dissembling the reason, asked him whether he would not take
a small beaker of the sweet white wine before he set out, and
offered to girdle the horse while his Reverence bitted and
bridled him. Before any answer could be returned, she had
begun. And having now satisfactorily executed her undertaking,
she felt irrepressible delight and glee at being able to
do what Ser Francesco had failed in. He was scarcely more
successful with his allotment of the labour; found unlooked-for
intricacies and complications in the machinery, wondered that
human wit could not simplify it, and declared that the animal had
never exhibited such restiveness before. In fact, he never had
experienced the same grooming. At this conjuncture, a green
cap made its appearance, bound with straw-coloured ribbon, and
surmounted with two bushy sprigs of hawthorn, of which the
globular buds were swelling, and some bursting, but fewer yet
open. It was young Simplizio Nardi, who sometimes came on
the Sunday morning to sweep the courtyard for Assunta.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh! this time you are come just when you were wanted,&#8217;
said the girl.</p>

<p>&#8216;Bridle, directly, Ser Francesco&#8217;s horse, and then go away
about your business.&#8217;</p>

<p>The youth blushed, and kissed Ser Francesco&#8217;s hand, begging
his permission. It was soon done. He then held the stirrup;
and Ser Francesco, with scarcely three efforts, was seated and
erect on the saddle. The horse, however, had somewhat more
inclination for the stable than for the expedition; and, as
Assunta was handing to the rider his long ebony staff, bearing
an ivory caduceus, the quadruped turned suddenly round.
Simplizio called him <i>bestiaccia</i>! and then, softening it, <i>poco
garbato</i>! and proposed to Ser Francesco that he should leave the
bastone behind, and take the crab-switch he presented to him,
giving at the same time a sample of its efficacy, which covered
the long grizzle hair of the worthy quadruped with a profusion
of pink blossoms, like embroidery. The offer was declined; but
Assunta told Simplizio to carry it himself, and to walk by the
side of Ser Canonico quite up to the church porch, having seen
what a sad, dangerous beast his reverence had under him.</p>

<p>With perfect good will, partly in the pride of obedience to
Assunta, and partly to enjoy the renown of accompanying a
canon of Holy Church, Simplizio did as she enjoined.</p>

<p>And now the sound of village bells, in many hamlets and
convents and churches out of sight, was indistinctly heard,
and lost again; and at last the five of Certaldo seemed to crow
over the faintness of them all. The freshness of the morning
was enough of itself to excite the spirits of youth; a portion of
which never fails to descend on years that are far removed from
it, if the mind has partaken in innocent mirth while it was its
season and its duty to enjoy it. Parties of young and old passed
the canonico and his attendant with mute respect, bowing and
bare-headed; for that ebony staff threw its spell over the tongue,
which the frank and hearty salutation of the bearer was inadequate
to break. Simplizio, once or twice, attempted to call
back an intimate of the same age with himself; but the utmost
he could obtain was a <i>riveritissimo</i>! and a genuflexion to the rider.
It is reported that a heart-burning rose up from it in the breast
of a cousin, some days after, too distinctly apparent in the long-drawn
appellation of <i>Gnor</i><a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Simplizio.</p>

<p>Ser Francesco moved gradually forward, his steed picking
his way along the lane, and looking fixedly on the stones with
all the sobriety of a mineralogist. He himself was well satisfied
with the pace, and told Simplizio to be sparing of the switch,
unless in case of a hornet or a gadfly. Simplizio smiled, toward
the hedge, and wondered at the condescension of so great a
theologian and astrologer, in joking with him about the gadflies
and hornets in the beginning of April. &#8216;Ah! there are men
in the world who can make wit out of anything!&#8217; said he to
himself.</p>

<p>As they approached the walls of the town, the whole country
was pervaded by a stirring and diversified air of gladness.
Laughter and songs and flutes and viols, inviting voices and
complying responses, mingled with merry bells and with processional
hymns, along the woodland paths and along the yellow
meadows. It was really the <i>Lord&#8217;s Day</i>, for He made His creatures
happy in it, and their hearts were thankful. Even the cruel
had ceased from cruelty; and the rich man alone exacted from
the animal his daily labour. Ser Francesco made this remark,
and told his youthful guide that he had never been before
where he could not walk to church on a Sunday; and that
nothing should persuade him to urge the speed of his beast, on
the seventh day, beyond his natural and willing foot&#8217;s-pace.
He reached the gates of Certaldo more than half an hour before
the time of service, and he found laurels suspended over them,
and being suspended; and many pleasant and beautiful faces
were protruded between the ranks of gentry and clergy who
awaited him. Little did he expect such an attendance; but
Fra Biagio of San Vivaldo, who himself had offered no
obsequiousness or respect, had scattered the secret of his visit
throughout the whole country. A young poet, the most
celebrated in the town, approached the canonico with a long
scroll of verses, which fell below the knee, beginning:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How shall we welcome our illustrious guest?</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p>To which Ser Francesco immediately replied: &#8216;Take your
favourite maiden, lead the dance with her, and bid all your
friends follow; you have a good half-hour for it.&#8217;</p>

<p>Universal applauses succeeded, the music struck up, couples
were instantly formed. The gentry on this occasion led out
the cittadinanza, as they usually do in the villeggiatura, rarely
in the carnival, and never at other times. The elder of the
priests stood round in their sacred vestments, and looked with
cordiality and approbation on the youths, whose hands and
arms could indeed do much, and did it, but whose active eyes
could rarely move upward the modester of their partners.</p>

<p>While the elder of the clergy were thus gathering the fruits
of their liberal cares and paternal exhortations, some of the
younger looked on with a tenderer sentiment, not unmingled
with regret. Suddenly the bells ceased; the figure of the dance
was broken; all hastened into the church; and many hands that
joined on the green, met together at the font, and touched the
brow reciprocally with its lustral waters, in soul-devotion.</p>

<p>After the service, and after a sermon a good church-hour in
length to gratify him, enriched with compliments from all
authors, Christian and Pagan, informing him at the conclusion
that, although he had been crowned in the Capitol, he must die,
being born mortal, Ser Francesco rode homeward. The sermon
seemed to have sunk deeply into him, and even into the horse
under him, for both of them nodded, both snorted, and one
stumbled. Simplizio was twice fain to cry:</p>

<p>&#8216;Ser Canonico! Riverenza! in this country if we sleep before
dinner it does us harm. There are stones in the road, Ser
Canonico, loose as eggs in a nest, and pretty nigh as thick
together, huge as mountains.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Good lad!&#8217; said Ser Francesco, rubbing his eyes, &#8216;toss the
biggest of them out of the way, and never mind the rest.&#8217;</p>

<p>The horse, although he walked, shuffled almost into an amble
as he approached the stable, and his master looked up at it
with nearly the same contentment. Assunta had been ordered
to wait for his return, and cried:</p>

<p>&#8216;O Ser Francesco! you are looking at our long apricot, that
runs the whole length of the stable and barn, covered with
blossoms as the old white hen is with feathers. You must come
in the summer, and eat this fine fruit with Signor Padrone.
You cannot think how ruddy and golden and sweet and mellow
it is. There are peaches in all the fields, and plums, and pears,
and apples, but there is not another apricot for miles and miles.
Ser Giovanni brought the stone from Naples before I was born:
a lady gave it to him when she had eaten only half the fruit off
it: but perhaps you may have seen her, for you have ridden
as far as Rome, or beyond. Padrone looks often at the fruit,
and eats it willingly; and I have seen him turn over the stones
in his plate, and choose one out from the rest, and put it into
his pocket, but never plant it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Where is the youth?&#8217; inquired Ser Francesco.</p>

<p>&#8216;Gone away,&#8217; answered the maiden.</p>

<p>&#8216;I wanted to thank him,&#8217; said the Canonico.</p>

<p>&#8216;May I tell him so?&#8217; asked she.</p>

<p>&#8216;And give him ...&#8217; continued he, holding a piece of silver.</p>

<p>&#8216;I will give him something of my own, if he goes on and
behaves well,&#8217; said she; &#8216;but Signor Padrone would drive him
away for ever, I am sure, if he were tempted in an evil hour to
accept a quattrino for any service he could render the friends
of the house.&#8217;</p>

<p>Ser Francesco was delighted with the graceful animation of
this ingenuous girl, and asked her, with a little curiosity, how
she could afford to make him a present.</p>

<p>&#8216;I do not intend to make him a present,&#8217; she replied: &#8216;but it
is better he should be rewarded by me,&#8217; she blushed and
hesitated, &#8216;or by Signor Padrone,&#8217; she added, &#8216;than by your
reverence. He has not done half his duty yet; not half. I will
teach him: he is quite a child; four months younger than me.&#8217;</p>

<p>Ser Francesco went into the house, saying to himself at the
doorway:</p>

<p>&#8216;Truth, innocence, and gentle manners have not yet left the
earth. There are sermons that never make the ears weary.
I have heard but few of them, and come from church for this.&#8217;</p>

<p>Whether Simplizio had obeyed some private signal from
Assunta, or whether his own delicacy had prompted him to
disappear, he was now again in the stable, and the manger was
replenished with hay. A bucket was soon after heard ascending
from the well; and then two words: &#8216;Thanks, Simplizio.&#8217;</p>

<p>When Petrarca entered the chamber, he found Boccaccio with
his breviary in his hand, not looking into it indeed, but repeating
a thanksgiving in an audible and impassioned tone of voice.
Seeing Ser Francesco, he laid the book down beside him, and
welcomed him.</p>

<p>&#8216;I hope you have an appetite after your ride,&#8217; said he, &#8216;for
you have sent home a good dinner before you.&#8217;</p>

<p>Ser Francesco did not comprehend him, and expressed it not
in words but in looks.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am afraid you will dine sadly late to-day: noon has struck
this half-hour, and you must wait another, I doubt. However,
by good luck, I had a couple of citrons in the house, intended
to assuage my thirst if the fever had continued. This being
over, by God&#8217;s mercy, I will try (please God!) whether we two
greyhounds cannot be a match for a leveret.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How is this?&#8217; said Ser Francesco.</p>

<p>&#8216;Young Marc-Antonio Grilli, the cleverest lad in the parish
at noosing any wild animal, is our patron of the feast. He has
wanted for many a day to say something in the ear of Matilda
Vercelli. Bringing up the leveret to my bedside, and opening
the lips, and cracking the knuckles, and turning the foot round
to show the quality and quantity of the hair upon it, and to
prove that it really and truly was a leveret, and might be eaten
without offence to my teeth, he informed me that he had left
his mother in the yard, ready to dress it for me; she having been
cook to the prior. He protested he owed the <i>crowned martyr</i>
a forest of leverets, boars, deers, and everything else within
them, for having commanded the most backward girls to
dance directly. Whereupon he darted forth at Matilda, saying,
&ldquo;The <i>crowned martyr</i> orders it,&rdquo; seizing both her hands, and
swinging her round before she knew what she was about. He
soon had an opportunity of applying a word, no doubt as
dexterously as hand or foot; and she said submissively, but
seriously, and almost sadly, &ldquo;Marc-Antonio, now all the people
have seen it, they will think it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#8216;And after a pause:</p>

<p>&#8216;&ldquo;I am quite ashamed: and so should you be: are not you
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#8216;The others had run into the church. Matilda, who scarcely
had noticed it, cried suddenly:</p>

<p>&#8216;&ldquo;O Santissima! we are quite alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#8216;&ldquo;Will you be mine?&rdquo; cried he, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>&#8216;&ldquo;Oh! they will hear you in the church,&rdquo; replied she.</p>

<p>&#8216;&ldquo;They shall, they shall,&rdquo; cried he again, as loudly.</p>

<p>&#8216;&ldquo;If you will only go away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#8216;&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#8216;&ldquo;Yes, yes, indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#8216;&ldquo;The Virgin hears you: fifty saints are witnesses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#8216;&ldquo;Ah! they know you made me: they will look kindly
on us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#8216;He released her hand: she ran into the church, doubling her
veil (I will answer for her) at the door, and kneeling as near it
as she could find a place.</p>

<p>&#8216;&ldquo;By St. Peter,&rdquo; said Marc-Antonio, &ldquo;if there is a leveret
in the wood, the <i>crowned martyr</i> shall dine upon it this blessed
day.&rdquo; And he bounded off, and set about his occupation.
I inquired what induced him to designate you by such a title.
He answered, that everybody knew you had received the crown
of martyrdom at Rome, between the pope and antipope, and
had performed many miracles, for which they had canonized
you, and that you wanted only to die to become a saint.&#8217;</p>

<p>The leveret was now served up, cut into small pieces, and
covered with a rich tenacious sauce, composed of sugar, citron,
and various spices. The appetite of Ser Francesco was contagious.
Never was dinner more enjoyed by two companions,
and never so much by a greater number. One glass of a fragrant
wine, the colour of honey, and unmixed with water, crowned
the repast. Ser Francesco then went into his own chamber,
and found, on his ample mattress, a cool, refreshing sleep, quite
sufficient to remove all the fatigues of the morning; and Ser
Giovanni lowered the pillow against which he had seated himself,
and fell into his usual repose. Their separation was not of long continuance:
and, the religious duties of the Sabbath having been performed,
a few reflections on literature were no longer interdicted.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> The land, O Giovanni, of your early youth, the
land of my only love, fascinates us no longer. Italy is our
country; and not ours only, but every man&#8217;s, wherever may
have been his wanderings, wherever may have been his birth,
who watches with anxiety the recovery of the Arts, and acknowledges
the supremacy of Genius. Besides, it is in Italy at last
that all our few friends are resident. Yours were left behind
you at Paris in your adolescence, if indeed any friendship can
exist between a Florentine and a Frenchman: mine at Avignon
were Italians, and older for the most part than myself. Here
we know that we are beloved by some, and esteemed by many.
It indeed gave me pleasure the first morning as I lay in bed,
to overhear the fondness and earnestness which a worthy priest
was expressing in your behalf.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> In mine?</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Yes indeed: what wonder?</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> A worthy priest?</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> None else, certainly.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Heard in bed! dreaming, dreaming; ay?</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> No indeed: my eyes and ears were wide open.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> The little parlour opens into your room. But
what priest could that be? Canonico Casini? He only comes
when we have a roast of thrushes, or some such small matter,
at table: and this is not the season; they are pairing. Plover
eggs might tempt him hitherward. If he heard a plover he
would not be easy, and would fain make her drop her oblation
before she had settled her nest.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> It is right and proper that you should be informed
who the clergyman was, to whom you are under an obligation.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Tell me something about it, for truly I am at a
loss to conjecture.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> He must unquestionably have been expressing a
kind and ardent solicitude for your eternal welfare. The first
words I heard on awakening were these:</p>

<p>&#8216;Ser Giovanni, although the best of masters ...&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Those were Assuntina&#8217;s.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> &#8216;... may hardly be quite so holy (not being priest
or friar) as your Reverence.&#8217;</p>

<p>She was interrupted by the question: &#8216;What conversation
holdeth he?&#8217;</p>

<p>She answered:</p>

<p>&#8216;He never talks of loving our neighbour with all our heart,
all our soul, and all our strength, although he often gives away
the last loaf in the pantry.&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> It was she! Why did she say that? the slut!</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> &#8216;He doth well,&#8217; replied the confessor. &#8216;Of the
Church, of the brotherhood, that is, of me, what discourses
holdeth he?&#8217;</p>

<p>I thought the question an indiscreet one; but confessors vary
in their advances to the seat of truth.</p>

<p>She proceeded to answer:</p>

<p>&#8216;He never said anything about the power of the Church to
absolve us, if we should happen to go astray a little in good
company, like your Reverence.&#8217;</p>

<p>Here, it is easy to perceive, is some slight ambiguity. Evidently
she meant to say, by the seduction of &#8216;bad&#8217; company, and to
express that his Reverence had asserted his power of absolution;
which is undeniable.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> I have my version.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> What may yours be?</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Frate Biagio; broad as daylight; the whole frock
round!</p>

<p>I would wager a flask of oil against a turnip, that he laid
another trap for a penance. Let us see how he went on. I
warrant, as he warmed, he left off limping in his paces, and bore
hard upon the bridle.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> &#8216;Much do I fear,&#8217; continued the expositor, &#8216;he
never spoke to thee, child, about another world.&#8217;</p>

<p>There was a silence of some continuance.</p>

<p>&#8216;Speak!&#8217; said the confessor.</p>

<p>&#8216;No indeed he never did, poor Padrone!&#8217; was the slow and
evidently reluctant avowal of the maiden; for, in the midst of
the acknowledgment her sighs came through the crevices of
the door: then, without any farther interrogation, and with
little delay, she added:</p>

<p>&#8216;But he often makes this look like it.&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> And now, if he had carried a holy scourge, it would
not have been on his shoulders that he would have laid it.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Zeal carries men often too far afloat; and confessors
in general wish to have the sole steerage of the conscience.
When she told him that your benignity made this world another
heaven, he warmly and sharply answered:</p>

<p>&#8216;It is only we who ought to do that.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Hush,&#8217; said the maiden; and I verily believe she at that
moment set her back against the door, to prevent the sounds
from coming through the crevices, for the rest of them seemed
to be just over my night-cap. &#8216;Hush,&#8217; said she, in the whole
length of that softest of all articulations. &#8216;There is Ser Francesco
in the next room: he sleeps long into the morning, but he is so
clever a clerk, he may understand you just the same. I doubt
whether he thinks Ser Giovanni in the wrong for making so
many people quite happy; and if he should, it would grieve me
very much to think he blamed Ser Giovanni.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who is Ser Francesco?&#8217; he asked, in a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ser Canonico,&#8217; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;Of what Duomo?&#8217; continued he.</p>

<p>&#8216;Who knows?&#8217; was the reply; &#8216;but he is Padrone&#8217;s heart&#8217;s
friend, for certain.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Cospetto di Bacco! It can then be no other than Petrarca.
He makes rhymes and love like the devil. Don&#8217;t listen to him,
or you are undone. Does he love you too, as well as Padrone?&#8217;
he asked, still lowering his voice.</p>

<p>&#8216;I cannot tell that matter,&#8217; she answered, somewhat impatiently;
&#8216;but I love him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;To my face!&#8217; cried he, smartly.</p>

<p>&#8216;To the Santissima!&#8217; replied she, instantaneously; &#8216;for have
not I told your Reverence he is Padrone&#8217;s true heart&#8217;s friend!
And are not you my confessor, when you come on purpose?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;True, true!&#8217; answered he; &#8216;but there are occasions when we
are shocked by the confession, and wish it made less daringly.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I was bold; but who can help loving him who loves my good
Padrone?&#8217; said she, much more submissively.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Brave girl, for that!</p>

<p>Dog of a Frate! They are all of a kidney; all of a kennel.
I would dilute their meal well and keep them low. They should
not waddle and wallop in every hollow lane, nor loll out their
watery tongues at every wash-pool in the parish. We shall
hear, I trust, no more about Fra Biagio in the house while you
are with us. Ah! were it then for life.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> The man&#8217;s prudence may be reasonably doubted,
but it were uncharitable to question his sincerity. Could a
neighbour, a religious one in particular, be indifferent to the
welfare of Boccaccio, or any belonging to him?</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> I do not complain of his indifference. Indifferent!
no, not he. He might as well be, though. My villetta here is
my castle: it was my father&#8217;s; it was his father&#8217;s. Cowls did
not hang to dry upon the same cord with caps in their podere;
they shall not in mine. The girl is an honest girl, Francesco,
though I say it. Neither she nor any other shall be befooled
and bamboozled under my roof. Methinks Holy Church might
contrive some improvement upon confession.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Hush! Giovanni! But, it being a matter of discipline,
who knows but she might.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Discipline! ay, ay, ay! faith and troth there are
some who want it.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> You really terrify me. These are sad surmises.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Sad enough: but I am keeper of my handmaiden&#8217;s
probity.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> It could not be kept safer.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> I wonder what the Frate would be putting into
her head?</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Nothing, nothing: be assured.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Why did he ask her all those questions?</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Confessors do occasionally take circuitous ways to
arrive at the secrets of the human heart.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> And sometimes they drive at it, me thinks, a whit
too directly. He had no business to make remarks about me.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Anxiety.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> &#8217;Fore God, Francesco, he shall have more of that;
for I will shut him out the moment I am again up and stirring,
though he stand but a nose&#8217;s length off. I have no fear about
the girl; no suspicion of her. He might whistle to the moon on
a frosty night, and expect as reasonably her descending. Never
was a man so entirely at his ease as I am about that; never,
never. She is adamant; a bright sword now first unscabbarded;
no breath can hang about it. A seal of beryl, of chrysolite, of
ruby; to make impressions (all in good time and proper place
though) and receive none: incapable, just as they are, of splitting,
or cracking, or flawing, or harbouring dirt. Let him mind that.
Such, I assure you, is that poor little wench, Assuntina.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> I am convinced that so well-behaved a young
creature as Assunta&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Right! Assunta is her name by baptism; we
usually call her Assuntina, because she is slender, and scarcely
yet full-grown, perhaps: but who can tell?</p>

<p>As for those friars, I never was a friend to impudence: I hate
loose suggestions. In girls&#8217; minds you will find little dust but
what is carried there by gusts from without. They seldom
want sweeping; when they do, the broom should be taken from
behind the house door, and the master should be the sacristan.</p>

<p>... Scarcely were these words uttered when Assunta was
heard running up the stairs; and the next moment she rapped.
Being ordered to come in, she entered with a willow twig in
her hand, from the middle of which willow twig (for she held
the two ends together) hung a fish, shining with green and gold.</p>

<p>&#8216;What hast there, young maiden?&#8217; said Ser Francesco.</p>

<p>&#8216;A fish, Riverenza!&#8217; answered she. &#8216;In Tuscany we call
it <i>tinca</i>.&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> I too am a little of a Tuscan.</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> Indeed! well, you really speak very like one, but
only more sweetly and slowly. I wonder how you can keep
up with Signor Padrone&mdash;he talks fast when he is in health;
and you have made him so. Why did not you come before?
Your Reverence has surely been at Certaldo in time past.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Yes, before thou wert born.</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> Ah, sir! it must have been long ago then.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Thou hast just entered upon life.</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> I am no child.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> What then art thou?</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> I know not: I have lost both father and mother;
there is a name for such as I am.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> And a place in heaven.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Who brought us that fish, Assunta? hast paid for
it? there must be seven pounds: I never saw the like.</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> I could hardly lift up my apron to my eyes with it
in my hand. Luca, who brought it all the way from the Padule,
could scarcely be entreated to eat a morsel of bread or sit down.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Give him a flask or two of our wine; he will like it
better than the sour puddle of the plain.</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> He is gone back.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Gone! who is he, pray?</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> Luca, to be sure.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> What Luca?</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> Dominedio! O Riverenza! how sadly must Ser
Giovanni, my poor Padrone, have lost his memory in this cruel
long illness! he cannot recollect young Luca of the Bientola,
who married Maria.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> I never heard of either, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> Be pleased to mention this in your prayers to-night,
Ser Canonico! May Our Lady soon give him back his memory!
and everything else she has been pleased (only in play, I hope)
to take away from him! Ser Francesco, you must have heard
all over the world how Maria Gargarelli, who lived in the service
of our paroco, somehow was outwitted by Satanasso. Monsignore
thought the paroco had not done all he might have done
against his wiles and craftiness, and sent his Reverence over
to the monastery in the mountains, Laverna yonder, to make
him look sharp; and there he is yet.</p>

<p>And now does Signor Padrone recollect?</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Rather more distinctly.</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> Ah me! Rather more distinctly! have patience,
Signor Padrone! I am too venturous, God help me! But,
Riverenza, when Maria was the scorn or the abhorrence of
everybody else, excepting poor Luca Sabbatini, who had always
cherished her, and excepting Signor Padrone, who had never
seen her in his lifetime ... for paroco Snello said he desired
no visits from any who took liberties with Holy Church ...
as if Padrone did! Luca one day came to me out of breath,
with money in his hand for our duck. Now it so happened that
the duck, stuffed with noble chestnuts, was going to table at
that instant. I told Signor Padrone....</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Assunta, I never heard thee repeat so long and
tiresome a story before, nor put thyself out of breath so. Come,
we have had enough of it.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> She is mortified: pray let her proceed.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> As you will.</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> I told Signor Padrone how Luca was lamenting that
Maria was seized with an <i>imagination</i>.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> No wonder then she fell into misfortune, and her
neighbours and friends avoided her.</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> Riverenza! how can you smile? Signor Padrone!
and you too? You shook your head and sighed at it when it
happened. The Demonio, who had caused all the first mischief,
was not contented until he had given her the <i>imagination</i>.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> He could not have finished his work more effectually.</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> He was balked, however. Luca said:</p>

<p>&#8216;She shall not die under her wrongs, please God!&#8217;</p>

<p>I repeated the words to Signor Padrone.... He seems to
listen, Riverenza! and will remember presently ... and Signor
Padrone cut away one leg for himself, clean forgetting all the
chestnuts inside, and said sharply, &#8216;Give the bird to Luca;
and, hark ye, bring back the minestra.&#8217;</p>

<p>Maria loved Luca with all her heart, and Luca loved Maria
with all his: but they both hated paroco Snello for such neglect
about the evil one. And even Monsignore, who sent for Luca
on purpose, had some difficulty in persuading him to forbear
from choler and discourse. For Luca, who never swears, swore
bitterly that the devil should play no such tricks again, nor
alight on girls napping in the parsonage. Monsignore thought
he intended to take violent possession, and to keep watch there
himself without consent of the incumbent. &#8216;I will have no
scandal,&#8217; said Monsignore; so there was none. Maria, though
she did indeed, as I told your Reverence, love her Luca dearly,
yet she long refused to marry him, and cried very much at last
on the wedding day, and said, as she entered the porch:</p>

<p>&#8216;Luca! it is not yet too late to leave me.&#8217;</p>

<p>He would have kissed her, but her face was upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>Pievano Locatelli married them, and gave them his blessing:
and going down from the altar, he said before the people, as
he stood on the last step: &#8216;Be comforted, child! be comforted!
God above knows that thy husband is honest, and that thou
art innocent.&#8217; Pievano&#8217;s voice trembled, for he was an aged
and holy man, and had walked two miles on the occasion.
Pulcheria, his governante, eighty years old, carried an apronful
of lilies to bestrew the altar; and partly from the lilies, and
partly from the blessed angels who (although invisible) were
present, the church was filled with fragrance. Many who heretofore
had been frightened at hearing the mention of Maria&#8217;s
name, ventured now to walk up toward her; and some gave her
needles, and some offered skeins of thread, and some ran home
again for pots of honey.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> And why didst not thou take her some trifle?</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> I had none.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Surely there are always such about the premises.</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> Not mine to give away.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> So then at thy hands, Assunta, she went off not
overladen. Ne&#8217;er a bone-bodkin out of thy bravery, ay?</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> I ran out knitting, with the woodbine and syringa
in the basket for the parlour. I made the basket ... I and
... but myself chiefly, for boys are loiterers.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Well, well: why not bestow the basket, together
with its rich contents?</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> I am ashamed to say it ... I covered my half-stocking
with them as quickly as I could, and ran after her,
and presented it. Not knowing what was under the flowers,
and never minding the liberty I had taken, being a stranger to
her, she accepted it as graciously as possible, and bade me be
happy.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> I hope you have always kept her command.</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> Nobody is ever unhappy here, except Fra Biagio,
who frets sometimes: but that may be the walk; or he may
fancy Ser Giovanni to be worse than he really is.</p>

<p>... Having now performed her mission and concluded her
narrative, she bowed, and said:</p>

<p>&#8216;Excuse me, Riverenza! excuse me, Signor Padrone! my arm
aches with this great fish.&#8217;</p>

<p>Then, bowing again, and moving her eyes modestly toward
each, she added, &#8216;with permission!&#8217; and left the chamber.</p>

<p>&#8216;About the sposina,&#8217; after a pause began Ser Francesco:
&#8216;about the sposina, I do not see the matter clearly.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You have studied too much for seeing all things clearly,&#8217;
answered Ser Giovanni; &#8216;you see only the greatest. In fine,
the devil, on this count, is acquitted by acclamation; and the
paroco Snello eats lettuce and chicory up yonder at Laverna.
He has mendicant friars for his society every day; and snails,
as pure as water can wash and boil them, for his repast on
festivals. Under this discipline, if they keep it up, surely one
devil out of legion will depart from him.&#8217;</p>

<h4><a name="FOURTH_DAYS_INTERVIEW" id="FOURTH_DAYS_INTERVIEW"></a>FOURTH DAY&#8217;S INTERVIEW</h4>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Giovanni, you are unsuspicious, and would scarcely
see a monster in a minotaur. It is well, however, to draw good
out of evil, and it is the peculiar gift of an elevated mind.
Nevertheless, you must have observed, although with greater
curiosity than concern, the slipperiness and tortuousness of
your detractors.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Whatever they detract from me, they leave more
than they can carry away. Beside, they always are detected.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> When they are detected, they raise themselves up
fiercely, as if their nature were erect and they could reach your
height.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Envy would conceal herself under the shadow and
shelter of contemptuousness, but she swells too huge for the den
she creeps into. Let her lie there and crack, and think no more
about her. The people you have been talking of can find no
greater and no other faults in my writings than I myself am
willing to show them, and still more willing to correct. There
are many things, as you have just now told me, very unworthy
of their company.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> He who has much gold is none the poorer for having
much silver too. When a king of old displayed his wealth and
magnificence before a philosopher, the philosopher&#8217;s exclamation
was:</p>

<p>&#8216;How many things are here which I do not want!&#8217;</p>

<p>Does not the same reflection come upon us, when we have
laid aside our compositions for a time, and look into them again
more leisurely? Do we not wonder at our own profusion, and
say like the philosopher:</p>

<p>&#8216;How many things are here which I do not want!&#8217;</p>

<p>It may happen that we pull up flowers with weeds; but
better this than rankness. We must bear to see our first-born
dispatched before our eyes, and give them up quietly.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> The younger will be the most reluctant. There
are poets among us who mistake in themselves the freckles
of the hay-fever for beauty-spots. In another half-century their
volumes will be inquired after; but only for the sake of cutting
out an illuminated letter from the title-page, or of transplanting
the willow at the end, that hangs so prettily over the tomb of
Amaryllis. If they wish to be healthy and vigorous, let them
open their bosoms to the breezes of Sunium; for the air of
Latium is heavy and overcharged. Above all, they must
remember two admonitions; first, that sweet things hurt
digestion; secondly, that great sails are ill adapted to small
vessels. What is there lovely in poetry unless there be moderation
and composure? Are they not better than the hot,
uncontrollable harlotry of a flaunting, dishevelled enthusiasm?
Whoever has the power of creating, has likewise the inferior
power of keeping his creation in order. The best poets are the
most impressive, because their steps are regular; for without
regularity there is neither strength nor state. Look at Sophocles,
look at Aeschylus, look at Homer.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> I agree with you entirely to the whole extent of
your observations; and, if you will continue, I am ready to lay
aside my Dante for the present.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> No, no; we must have him again between us: there
is no danger that he will sour our tempers.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> In comparing his and yours, since you forbid me
to declare all I think of your genius, you will at least allow me
to congratulate you as being the happier of the two.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Frequently, where there is great power in poetry,
the imagination makes encroachments on the heart, and uses
it as her own. I have shed tears on writings which never cost
the writer a sigh, but which occasioned him to rub the palms
of his hands together, until they were ready to strike fire,
with satisfaction at having overcome the difficulty of being
tender.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Giovanni! are you not grown satirical?</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Not in this. It is a truth as broad and glaring
as the eye of the Cyclops. To make you amends for your
shuddering, I will express my doubt, on the other hand, whether
Dante felt all the indignation he threw into his poetry. We
are immoderately fond of warming ourselves; and we do not
think, or care, what the fire is composed of. Be sure it is not
always of cedar, like Circe&#8217;s. Our Alighieri had slipped into
the habit of vituperation; and he thought it fitted him; so he
never left it off.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Serener colours are pleasanter to our eyes and more
becoming to our character. The chief desire in every man of
genius is to be thought one; and no fear or apprehension lessens
it. Alighieri, who had certainly studied the gospel, must have
been conscious that he not only was inhumane, but that he
betrayed a more vindictive spirit than any pope or prelate who
is enshrined within the fretwork of his golden grating.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Unhappily, his strong talon had grown into him,
and it would have pained him to suffer amputation. This
eagle, unlike Jupiter&#8217;s, never loosened the thunderbolt from it
under the influence of harmony.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> The only good thing we can expect in such minds
and tempers is good poetry: let us at least get that; and, having
it, let us keep and value it. If you had never written some
wanton stories, you would never have been able to show the
world how much wiser and better you grew afterward.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Alas! if I live, I hope to show it. You have
raised my spirits: and now, dear Francesco! do say a couple of
prayers for me, while I lay together the materials of a tale;
a right merry one, I promise you. Faith! it shall amuse you,
and pay decently for the prayers; a good honest litany-worth.
I hardly know whether I ought to have a nun in it: do you
think I may?</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Cannot you do without one?</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> No; a nun I must have: say nothing against her;
I can more easily let the abbess alone. Yet Frate Biagio ...
that Frate Biagio, who never came to visit me but when he
thought I was at extremities or asleep.... Assuntina! are
you there?</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> No; do you want her?</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Not a bit. That Frate Biagio has heightened my
pulse when I could not lower it again. The very devil is that
Frate for heightening pulses. And with him I shall now make
merry ... God willing ... in God&#8217;s good time ... should
it be His divine will to restore me! which I think He has begun
to do miraculously. I seem to be within a frog&#8217;s leap of well
again; and we will presently have some rare fun in my <i>Tale of
the Frate</i>.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Do not openly name him.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> He shall recognize himself by one single expression.
He said to me, when I was at the worst:</p>

<p>&#8216;Ser Giovanni! it would not be much amiss (with permission!)
if you begin to think (at any spare time), just a morsel, of
eternity.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah! Fra Biagio!&#8217; answered I, contritely, &#8216;I never heard a
sermon of yours but I thought of it seriously and uneasily, long
before the discourse was over.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;So must all,&#8217; replied he, &#8216;and yet few have the grace to own it.&#8217;</p>

<p>Now mind, Francesco! if it should please the Lord to call
me unto Him, I say, <i>The Nun and Fra Biagio</i> will be found, after
my decease, in the closet cut out of the wall, behind yon Saint
Zacharias in blue and yellow.</p>

<p>Well done! well done! Francesco. I never heard any man
repeat his prayers so fast and fluently. Why! how many (at a
guess) have you repeated? Such is the power of friendship,
and such the habit of religion! They have done me good:
I feel myself stronger already. To-morrow I think I shall be
able, by leaning on that stout maple stick in the corner, to walk
half over my podere.</p>

<p>Have you done? have you done?</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Be quiet: you may talk too much.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> I cannot be quiet for another hour; so, if you have
any more prayers to get over, stick the spur into the other side
of them: they must verily speed, if they beat the last.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Be more serious, dear Giovanni.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Never bid a convalescent be more serious: no, nor
a sick man neither. To health it may give that composure
which it takes away from sickness. Every man will have his
hours of seriousness; but, like the hours of rest, they often are
ill-chosen and unwholesome. Be assured, our heavenly Father
is as well pleased to see His children in the playground as in the
schoolroom. He has provided both for us, and has given us
intimations when each should occupy us.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> You are right, Giovanni! but we know which bell
is heard the most distinctly. We fold our arms at the one, try
the cooler part of the pillow, and turn again to slumber; at the
first stroke of the other, we are beyond our monitors. As for
you, hardly Dante himself could make you grave.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> I do not remember how it happened that we slipped
away from his side. One of us must have found him tedious.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> If you were really and substantially at his side, he
would have no mercy on you.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> In sooth, our good Alighieri seems to have had
the appetite of a dogfish or shark, and to have bitten the harder
the warmer he was. I would not voluntarily be under his
manifold rows of dentals. He has an incisor to every saint in
the calendar. I should fare, methinks, like Brutus and the
archbishop. He is forced to stretch himself, out of sheer listlessness,
in so idle a place as Purgatory: he loses half his strength
in Paradise: Hell alone makes him alert and lively: there he
moves about and threatens as tremendously as the serpent
that opposed the legions on their march in Africa. He would
not have been contented in Tuscany itself, even had his enemies
left him unmolested. Were I to write on his model a tripartite
poem, I think it should be entitled, <i>Earth, Italy, and Heaven</i>.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> You will never give yourself the trouble.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> I should not succeed.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Perhaps not: but you have done very much, and
may be able to do very much more.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Wonderful is it to me, when I consider that an
infirm and helpless creature, as I am, should be capable of laying
thoughts up in their cabinets of words, which Time, as he rushes
by, with the revolutions of stormy and destructive years, can
never move from their places. On this coarse mattress, one
among the homeliest in the fair at Impruneta, is stretched an
old burgess of Certaldo, of whom perhaps more will be known
hereafter than we know of the Ptolemies and the Pharaohs;
while popes and princes are lying as unregarded as the fleas
that are shaken out of the window. Upon my life, Francesco!
to think of this is enough to make a man presumptuous.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> No, Giovanni! not when the man thinks justly
of it, as such a man ought to do, and must. For so mighty a
power over Time, who casts all other mortals under his, comes
down to us from a greater; and it is only if we abuse the victory
that it were better we had encountered a defeat. Unremitting
care must be taken that nothing soil the monuments we are
raising: sure enough we are that nothing can subvert, and
nothing but our negligence, or worse than negligence, efface
them. Under the glorious lamp entrusted to your vigilance,
one among the lights of the world, which the ministering angels
of our God have suspended for His service, let there stand, with
unclosing eyes, Integrity, Compassion, Self-denial.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> These are holier and cheerfuller images than
Dante has been setting up before us. I hope every thesis in
dispute among his theologians will be settled ere I set foot among
them. I like Tuscany well enough: it answers all my purposes
for the present: and I am without the benefit of those preliminary
studies which might render me a worthy auditor of
incomprehensible wisdom.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> I do not wonder you are attached to Tuscany.
Many as have been your visits and adventures in other parts,
you have rendered it pleasanter and more interesting than any:
and indeed we can scarcely walk in any quarter from the gates
of Florence without the recollection of some witty or affecting
story related by you. Every street, every farm, is peopled
by your genius: and this population cannot change with seasons
or with ages, with factions or with incursions. Ghibellines and
Guelphs will have been contested for only by the worms, long
before the <i>Decameron</i> has ceased to be recited on our banks of
blue lilies and under our arching vines. Another plague may
come amidst us; and something of a solace in so terrible a
visitation would be found in your pages, by those to whom letters
are a refuge and relief.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> I do indeed think my little bevy from Santa Maria
Novella would be better company on such an occasion, than a
devil with three heads, who diverts the pain his claws inflicted,
by sticking his fangs in another place.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> This is atrocious, not terrific nor grand. Alighieri
is grand by his lights, not by his shadows; by his human
affections, not by his infernal. As the minutest sands are the
labours of some profound sea, or the spoils of some vast mountain,
in like manner his horrid wastes and wearying minutenesses
are the chafings of a turbulent spirit, grasping the loftiest things
and penetrating the deepest, and moving and moaning on the
earth in loneliness and sadness.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Among men he is what among waters is</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The strange, mysterious, solitary Nile.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Is that his verse? I do not remember it.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> No, it is mine for the present: how long it may
continue mine I cannot tell. I never run after those who steal
my apples: it would only tire me: and they are hardly worth recovering
when they are bruised and bitten, as they are usually.
I would not stand upon my verses: it is a perilous boy&#8217;s trick,
which we ought to leave off when we put on square shoes. Let
our prose show what we are, and our poetry what we have been.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> You would never have given this advice to Alighieri.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> I would never plough porphyry; there is ground
fitter for grain. Alighieri is the parent of his system, like the
sun, about whom all the worlds are but particles thrown forth
from him. We may write little things well, and accumulate
one upon another; but never will any be justly called a great
poet unless he has treated a great subject worthily. He may
be the poet of the lover and of the idler, he may be the poet of
green fields or gay society; but whoever is this can be no more.
A throne is not built of birds&#8217;-nests, nor do a thousand reeds
make a trumpet.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> I wish Alighieri had blown his on nobler occasions.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> We may rightly wish it: but, in regretting what
he wanted, let us acknowledge what he had: and never forget
(which we omitted to mention) that he borrowed less from his
predecessors than any of the Roman poets from theirs. Reasonably
may it be expected that almost all who follow will be greatly
more indebted to antiquity, to whose stores we, every year,
are making some addition.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> It can be held no flaw in the title-deeds of genius,
if the same thoughts reappear as have been exhibited long ago.
The indisputable sign of defect should be looked for in the
proportion they bear to the unquestionably original. There are
ideas which necessarily must occur to minds of the like magnitude
and materials, aspect and temperature. When two ages
are in the same phasis, they will excite the same humours, and
produce the same coincidences and combinations. In addition
to which, a great poet may really borrow: he may even condescend
to an obligation at the hand of an equal or inferior: but
he forfeits his title if he borrows more than the amount of his
own possessions. The nightingale himself takes somewhat of
his song from birds less glorified: and the lark, having beaten
with her wing the very gates of heaven, cools her breast among
the grass. The lowlier of intellect may lay out a table in their
field, at which table the highest one shall sometimes be disposed
to partake: want does not compel him. Imitation, as we call
it, is often weakness, but it likewise is often sympathy.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Our poet was seldom accessible in this quarter.
Invective picks up the first stone on the wayside, and wants
leisure to consult a forerunner.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Dante (original enough everywhere) is coarse and
clumsy in this career. Vengeance has nothing to do with comedy,
nor properly with satire. The satirist who told us that Indignation
made his verses for him, might have been told in return
that she excluded him thereby from the first class, and thrust
him among the rhetoricians and declaimers. Lucretius, in his
vituperation, is graver and more dignified than Alighieri.
Painful; to see how tolerant is the atheist, how intolerant the
Catholic: how anxiously the one removes from among the sufferings
of Mortality, her last and heaviest, the fear of a vindictive
Fury pursuing her shadow across rivers of fire and tears; how
laboriously the other brings down Anguish and Despair, even
when Death has done his work. How grateful the one is to
that beneficent philosopher who made him at peace with himself,
and tolerant and kindly toward his fellow-creatures! how
importunate the other that God should forgo His divine mercy,
and hurl everlasting torments both upon the dead and the living!</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> I have always heard that Ser Dante was a very
good man and sound Catholic: but Christ forgive me if my
heart is oftener on the side of Lucretius!<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Observe, I say, my
heart; nothing more. I devoutly hold to the sacraments and
the mysteries: yet somehow I would rather see men tranquillized
than frightened out of their senses, and rather fast asleep than
burning. Sometimes I have been ready to believe, as far as
our holy faith will allow me, that it were better our Lord were
nowhere, than torturing in His inscrutable wisdom, to all eternity,
so many myriads of us poor devils, the creatures of His hands.
Do not cross thyself so thickly, Francesco! nor hang down thy
nether lip so loosely, languidly, and helplessly; for I would be
a good Catholic, alive or dead. But, upon my conscience, it
goes hard with me to think it of Him, when I hear that woodlark
yonder, gushing with joyousness, or when I see the beautiful
clouds, resting so softly one upon another, dissolving ... and
not damned for it. Above all, I am slow to apprehend it, when
I remember His great goodness vouchsafed to me, and reflect
on my sinful life heretofore, chiefly in summer time, and in cities,
or their vicinity. But I was tempted beyond my strength; and
I fell as any man might do. However, this last illness, by God&#8217;s
grace, has well-nigh brought me to my right mind again in all
such matters: and if I get stout in the present month, and can
hold out the next without sliding, I do verily think I am safe,
or nearly so, until the season of beccaficoes.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Be not too confident!</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Well, I will not be.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> But be firm.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Assuntina! what! are you come in again?</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> Did you or my master call me, Riverenza?</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> No, child!</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Oh! get you gone! Get you gone! you little
rogue you!</p>

<p>Francesco, I feel quite well. Your kindness to my playful
creatures in the <i>Decameron</i> has revived me, and has put me
into good humour with the greater part of them. Are you quite
certain the Madonna will not expect me to keep my promise?
You said you were: I need not ask you again. I will accept the
whole of your assurances, and half your praises.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> To represent so vast a variety of personages so
characteristically as you have done, to give the wise all their
wisdom, the witty all their wit, and (what is harder to do
advantageously) the simple all their simplicity, requires a genius
such as you alone possess. Those who doubt it are the least
dangerous of your rivals.</p>

<h4><a name="FIFTH_DAYS_INTERVIEW" id="FIFTH_DAYS_INTERVIEW"></a>FIFTH DAY&#8217;S INTERVIEW</h4>

<p>It being now the last morning that Petrarca could remain with
his friend, he resolved to pass early into his bedchamber.
Boccaccio had risen and was standing at the open window, with
his arms against it. Renovated health sparkled in the eyes of
the one; surprise and delight and thankfulness to Heaven
filled the other&#8217;s with sudden tears. He clasped Giovanni,
kissed his flaccid and sallow cheek, and falling on his knees,
adored the Giver of life, the source of health to body and soul.
Giovanni was not unmoved: he bent one knee as he leaned on
the shoulder of Francesco, looking down into his face, repeating
his words, and adding:</p>

<p>&#8216;Blessed be Thou, O Lord! who sendest me health again!
and blessings on Thy messenger who brought it.&#8217;</p>

<p>He had slept soundly; for ere he closed his eyes he had unburdened
his mind of its freight, not only by employing the
prayers appointed by Holy Church, but likewise by ejaculating;
as sundry of the fathers did of old. He acknowledged his
contrition for many transgressions, and chiefly for uncharitable
thoughts of Fra Biagio: on which occasion he turned fairly
round on his couch, and leaning his brow against the wall, and
his body being in a becomingly curved position, and proper for
the purpose, he thus ejaculated:</p>

<p>&#8216;Thou knowest, O most Holy Virgin! that never have I
spoken to handmaiden at this villetta, or within my mansion
at Certaldo, wantonly or indiscreetly, but have always been,
inasmuch as may be, the guardian of innocence; deeming it
better, when irregular thoughts assailed me, to ventilate them
abroad than to poison the house with them. And if, sinner as
I am, I have thought uncharitably of others, and more especially
of Fra Biagio, pardon me, out of thy exceeding great mercies!
And let it not be imputed to me, if I have kept, and may keep
hereafter, an eye over him, in wariness and watchfulness; not
otherwise. For thou knowest, O Madonna! that many who
have a perfect and unwavering faith in thee, yet do cover up
their cheese from the nibblings of vermin.&#8217;</p>

<p>Whereupon, he turned round again, threw himself on his back
at full length, and feeling the sheets cool, smooth, and refreshing,
folded his arms, and slept instantaneously. The consequence
of his wholesome slumber was a calm alacrity: and
the idea that his visitor would be happy at seeing him on his
feet again, made him attempt to get up: at which he succeeded,
to his own wonder. And it was increased by the manifestation
of his strength in opening the casement, stiff from being closed,
and swelled by the continuance of the rains. The morning was
warm and sunny: and it is known that on this occasion he
composed the verses below:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My old familiar cottage-green!</span><br />
<span class="i0">I see once more thy pleasant sheen;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The gossamer suspended over</span><br />
<span class="i0">Smart celandine by lusty clover;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the last blossom of the plum</span><br />
<span class="i0">Inviting her first leaves to come;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Which hang a little back, but show</span><br />
<span class="i0">&#8217;Tis not their nature to say no.</span><br />
<span class="i0">I scarcely am in voice to sing</span><br />
<span class="i0">How graceful are the steps of Spring;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And ah! it makes me sigh to look</span><br />
<span class="i0">How leaps along my merry brook,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The very same to-day as when</span><br />
<span class="i0">He chirrupt first to maids and men.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> I can rejoice at the freshness of your feelings: but
the sight of the green turf reminds me rather of its ultimate
use and destination.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For many serves the parish pall,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The turf in common serves for all.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Very true; and, such being the case, let us carefully
fold it up, and lay it by until we call for it.</p>

<p>Francesco, you made me quite light-headed yesterday. I
am rather too old to dance either with Spring, as I have been
saying, or with Vanity: and yet I accepted her at your hand as
a partner. In future, no more of comparisons for me! You
not only can do me no good, but you can leave me no pleasure:
for here I shall remain the few days I have to live, and shall
see nobody who will be disposed to remind me of your praises.
Beside, you yourself will get hated for them. We neither can
deserve praise nor receive it with impunity.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Have you never remarked that it is into quiet
water that children throw pebbles to disturb it? and that it
is into deep caverns that the idle drop sticks and dirt? We
must expect such treatment.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Your admonition shall have its wholesome influence
over me, when the fever your praises have excited has grown
moderate.</p>

<p>... After the conversation on this topic and various others
had continued some time, it was interrupted by a visitor. The
clergy and monkery at Certaldo had never been cordial with
Messer Giovanni, it being suspected that certain of his <i>Novelle</i>
were modelled on originals in their orders. Hence, although
they indeed both professed and felt esteem for Canonico Petrarca,
they abstained from expressing it at the villetta. But Frate
Biagio of San Vivaldo was (by his own appointment) the friend
of the house; and, being considered as very expert in pharmacy,
had, day after day, brought over no indifferent store of simples,
in ptisans, and other refections, during the continuance of
Ser Giovanni&#8217;s ailment. Something now moved him to cast
about in his mind whether it might not appear dutiful to make
another visit. Perhaps he thought it possible that, among those
who peradventure had seen him lately on the road, one or other
might expect from him a solution of the questions, What sort of
person was the <i>crowned martyr</i>? whether he carried a palm in
his hand? whether a seam was visible across the throat? whether
he wore a ring over his glove, with a chrysolite in it, like the
bishops, but representing the city of Jerusalem and the judgment-seat
of Pontius Pilate? Such were the reports; but the inhabitants
of San Vivaldo could not believe the Certaldese, who,
inhabiting the next township to them, were naturally their
enemies. Yet they might believe Frate Biagio, and certainly
would interrogate him accordingly. He formed his determination,
put his frock and hood on, and gave a curvature to his
shoe, to evince his knowledge of the world, by pushing the
extremity of it with his breast-bone against the corner of his
cell. Studious of his figure and of his attire, he walked as much
as possible on his heels, to keep up the reformation he had
wrought in the workmanship of the cordwainer. On former
occasions he had borrowed a horse, as being wanted to hear
confession or to carry medicines, which might otherwise be too
late. But, having put on an entirely new habiliment, and it
being the season when horses are beginning to do the same, he
deemed it prudent to travel on foot. Approaching the villetta,
his first intention was to walk directly into his patient&#8217;s room:
but he found it impossible to resist the impulses of pride, in
showing Assunta his rigid and stately frock, and shoes rather
of the equestrian order than the monastic. So he went into the
kitchen where the girl was at work, having just taken away the
remains of the breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8216;Frate Biagio!&#8217; cried she, &#8216;is this you? Have you been sleeping
at Conte Jeronimo&#8217;s?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Not I,&#8217; replied he.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why!&#8217; said she, &#8216;those are surely his shoes! Santa Maria!
you must have put them on in the dusk of the morning, to say
your prayers in! Here! here! take these old ones of Signor
Padrone, for the love of God! I hope your Reverence met
nobody.&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> What dost smile at?</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> Smile at! I could find in my heart to laugh outright,
if I only were certain that nobody had seen your Reverence
in such a funny trim. Riverenza! put on these.</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> Not I indeed.</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> Allow me then?</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> No, nor you.</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> Then let me stand upon yours, to push down the
points.</p>

<p>... Frate Biagio now began to relent a little, when Assunta,
who had made one step toward the project, bethought herself
suddenly, and said:</p>

<p>&#8216;No; I might miss my footing. But, mercy upon us! what
made you cramp your Reverence with those ox-yoke shoes?
and strangle your Reverence with that hangdog collar?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;If you must know,&#8217; answered the Frate, reddening, &#8216;it was
because I am making a visit to the Canonico of Parma. I
should like to know something about him: perhaps you could
tell me?&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> Ever so much.</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> I thought no less: indeed I knew it. Which goes to
bed first?</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> Both together.</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> Demonio! what dost mean?</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> He tells me never to sit up waiting, but to say my
prayers and dream of the Virgin.</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> As if it was any business of his! Does he put out his
lamp himself?</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> To be sure he does: why should not he? what
should he be afraid of? It is not winter: and beside, there is a
mat upon the floor, all round the bed, excepting the top and
bottom.</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> I am quite convinced he never said anything to make
you blush. Why are you silent?</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> I have a right.</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> He did then? ay? Do not nod your head: that will
never do. Discreet girls speak plainly.</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> What would you have?</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> The truth; the truth; again, I say, the truth.</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> He <i>did</i> then.</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> I knew it! The most dangerous man living!</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> Ah! indeed he is! Signor Padrone said so.</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> He knows him of old: he warned you, it seems.</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> Me! He never said it was I who was in danger.</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> He might: it was his duty.</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> Am I so fat? Lord! you may feel every rib. Girls
who run about as I do, slip away from apoplexy.</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> Ho! ho! that is all, is it?</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> And bad enough too! that such good-natured men
should ever grow so bulky; and stand in danger, as Padrone
said they both do, of such a seizure?</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> What? and art ready to cry about it? Old folks cannot
die easier: and there are always plenty of younger to run
quick enough for a confessor. But I must not trifle in this
manner. It is my duty to set your feet in the right way: it
is my bounden duty to report to Ser Giovanni all irregularities
I know of, committed in his domicile. I could indeed, and
would, remit a trifle, on hearing the worst. Tell me now,
Assunta! tell me, you little angel! did you ... we all may,
the very best of us may, and do ... sin, my sweet?</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> You may be sure I did not: for whenever I sin I
run into church directly, although it snows or thunders: else I
never could see again Padrone&#8217;s face, or any one&#8217;s.</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> You do not come to me.</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> You live at San Vivaldo.</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> But when there is sin so pressing I am always ready
to be found. You perplex, you puzzle me. Tell me at once
how he made you blush.</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> Well then!</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> Well then! you did not hang back so before him. I
lose all patience.</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> So famous a man!...</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> No excuse in that.</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> So dear to Padrone....</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> The more shame for him!</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> Called me....</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> And <i>called</i> you, did he! the traitorous swine!</p>

<p><i>Assunta.</i> Called me ... <i>good girl</i>.</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> Psha! the wenches, I think, are all mad: but few of
them in this manner.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>... Without saying another word, Fra Biagio went forward
and opened the bedchamber door, saying briskly:</p>

<p>&#8216;Servant! Ser Giovanni! Ser Canonico! most devoted! most
obsequious! I venture to incommode you. Thanks to God,
Ser Canonico, you are looking well for your years. They tell
me you were formerly (who would believe it?) the handsomest
man in Christendom, and worked your way glibly, yonder
at Avignon.</p>

<p>&#8216;Capperi! Ser Giovanni! I never observed that you were
sitting bolt-upright in that long-backed armchair, instead of
lying abed. Quite in the right. I am rejoiced at such a change
for the better. Who advised it?&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> So many thanks to Fra Biagio! I not only am
sitting up, but have taken a draught of fresh air at the window,
and every leaf had a little present of sunshine for me.</p>

<p>There is one pleasure, Fra Biagio, which I fancy you never
have experienced, and I hardly know whether I ought to
wish it you; the first sensation of health after a long
confinement.</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> Thanks! infinite! I would take any man&#8217;s word for
that, without a wish to try it. Everybody tells me I am exactly
what I was a dozen years ago; while, for my part, I see everybody
changed: those who ought to be much about my age,
even those.... Per Bacco! I told them my thoughts when
they had told me theirs; and they were not so agreeable as they
used to be in former days.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> How people hate sincerity!</p>

<p>Cospetto! why, Frate! what hast got upon thy toes? Hast
killed some Tartar and tucked his bow into one, and torn the
crescent from the vizier&#8217;s tent to make the other match it?
Hadst thou fallen in thy mettlesome expedition (and it is a
mercy and a miracle thou didst not) those sacrilegious shoes
would have impaled thee.</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> It was a mistake in the shoemaker. But no pain or
incommodity whatsoever could detain me from paying my duty
to Ser Canonico, the first moment I heard of his auspicious arrival,
or from offering my congratulations to Ser Giovanni, on the
annunciation that he was recovered and looking out of the
window. All Tuscany was standing on the watch for it, and
the news flew like lightning. By this time it is upon the
Danube.</p>

<p>And pray, Ser Canonico, how does Madonna Laura do?</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Peace to her gentle spirit! she is departed.</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> Ay, true. I had quite forgotten: that is to say, I
recollect it. You told us as much, I think, in a poem on her
death. Well, and do you know! our friend Giovanni here is
a bit of an author in his way.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Frate! you confuse my modesty.</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> Murder will out. It is a fact, on my conscience.
Have you never heard anything about it, Canonico! Ha! we
poets are sly fellows: we can keep a secret.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Are you quite sure you can?</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> Try, and trust me with any. I am a confessional
on legs: there is no more a whisper in me than in a woolsack.</p>

<p>I am in feather again, as you see; and in tune, as you shall hear.</p>

<p>April is not the month for moping. Sing it lustily.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Let it be your business to sing it, being a Frate;
I can only recite it.</p>

<p><i>Frate.</i> Pray do, then.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i></p>

<div class="poem">

<span class="i0">Passi pur, ma passi adagio.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Frate.</i> Well now really, Canonico, for one not exactly one of
us, that canzone of Ser Giovanni has merit; has not it? I did
not ride, however, to-day; as you may see by the lining of my
frock. But <i>plus non vitiat</i>; ay, Canonico! About the roads
he is right enough; they are the devil&#8217;s own roads; that must be
said for them.</p>

<p>Ser Giovanni! with permission; your mention of eggs in the
canzone has induced me to fancy I could eat a pair of them.
The hens lay well now: that white one of yours is worth more
than the goose that laid the golden: and you have a store of
others, her equals or betters: we have none like them at poor
St. Vivaldo. <i>A riverderci, Ser Giovanni! Schiavo! Ser Canonico!
mi commandino.</i></p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>... Fra Biagio went back into the kitchen, helped himself
to a quarter of a loaf, ordered a flask of wine, and, trying several
eggs against his lips, selected seven, which he himself fried in
oil, although the maid offered her services. He never had been
so little disposed to enter into conversation with her; and on
her asking him how he found her master, he replied, that in
bodily health Ser Giovanni, by his prayers and ptisans, had much
improved, but that his faculties were wearing out apace. &#8216;He
may now run in the same couples with the Canonico: they cannot
catch the mange one of the other: the one could say nothing
to the purpose, and the other nothing at all. The whole conversation
was entirely at my charge,&#8217; added he. &#8216;And now,
Assunta, since you press it, I will accept the service of your
master&#8217;s shoes. How I shall ever get home I don&#8217;t know.&#8217;
He took the shoes off the handles of the bellows, where Assunta
had placed them out of her way, and tucking one of his own
under each arm, limped toward St. Vivaldo.</p>

<p>The unwonted attention to smartness of apparel, in the only
article wherein it could be displayed, was suggested to Frate
Biagio by hearing that Ser Francesco, accustomed to courtly
habits and elegant society, and having not only small hands,
but small feet, usually wore red slippers in the morning. Fra
Biagio had scarcely left the outer door, than he cordially cursed
Ser Francesco for making such a fool of him, and wearing slippers
of black list. &#8216;These canonicoes,&#8217; said he, &#8216;not only lie themselves,
but teach everybody else to do the same. He has lamed
me for life: I burn as if I had been shod at the blacksmith&#8217;s forge.&#8217;</p>

<p>The two friends said nothing about him, but continued the
discourse which his visit had interrupted.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Turn again, I entreat you, to the serious; and do
not imagine that because by nature you are inclined to playfulness,
you must therefore write ludicrous things better. Many
of your stories would make the gravest men laugh, and yet there
is little wit in them.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> I think so myself; though authors, little disposed
as they are to doubt their possession of any quality they would
bring into play, are least of all suspicious on the side of wit.
You have convinced me. I am glad to have been tender, and
to have written tenderly: for I am certain it is this alone that
has made you love me with such affection.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Not this alone, Giovanni! but this principally. I
have always found you kind and compassionate, liberal and
sincere, and when Fortune does not stand very close to such a
man, she leaves only the more room for Friendship.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Let her stand off then, now and for ever! To
my heart, to my heart, Francesco! preserver of my health, my
peace of mind, and (since you tell me I may claim it) my glory.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Recovering your strength you must pursue your
studies to complete it. What can you have been doing with
your books? I have searched in vain this morning for the
treasury. Where are they kept? Formerly they were always
open. I found only a short manuscript, which I suspect is
poetry, but I ventured not on looking into it, until I had brought
it with me and laid it before you.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Well guessed! They are verses written by a
gentleman who resided long in this country, and who much
regretted the necessity of leaving it. He took great delight in
composing both Latin and Italian, but never kept a copy
of them latterly, so that these are the only ones I could obtain
from him. Read: for your voice will improve them:</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> There have been those anciently who would have
been pleased with such poetry, and perhaps there may be again.
I am not sorry to see the Muses by the side of childhood, and
forming a part of the family. But now tell me about the books.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Resolving to lay aside the more valuable of those
I had collected or transcribed, and to place them under the
guardianship of richer men, I locked them up together in the
higher story of my tower at Certaldo. You remember the old
tower?</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Well do I remember the hearty laugh we had
together (which stopped us upon the staircase) at the calculation
we made, how much longer you and I, if we continued to
thrive as we had thriven latterly, should be able to pass within
its narrow circle. Although I like this little villa much better,
I would gladly see the place again, and enjoy with you, as we
did before, the vast expanse of woodlands and mountains and
maremma; frowning fortresses inexpugnable; and others more
prodigious for their ruins; then below them, lordly abbeys,
overcanopied with stately trees and girded with rich luxuriance;
and towns that seem approaching them to do them honour, and
villages nestling close at their sides for sustenance and protection.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> My disorder, if it should keep its promise of
leaving me at last, will have been preparing me for the accomplishment
of such a project. Should I get thinner and thinner
at this rate, I shall soon be able to mount not only a turret or
a belfry, but a tube of macarone, while a Neapolitan is
suspending it for deglutition.</p>

<p>What I am about to mention will show you how little you
can rely on me! I have preserved the books, as you desired,
but quite contrary to my resolution: and, no less contrary to it,
by your desire I shall now preserve the <i>Decameron</i>. In vain
had I determined not only to mend in future, but to correct the
past; in vain had I prayed most fervently for grace to accomplish
it, with a final aspiration to Fiametta that she would unite with
your beloved Laura, and that, gentle and beatified spirits as
they are, they would breathe together their purer prayers on
mine. See what follows.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Sigh not at it. Before we can see all that follows
from their intercession, we must join them again. But let me
hear anything in which they are concerned.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> I prayed; and my breast, after some few tears,
grew calmer. Yet sleep did not ensue until the break of morning,
when the dropping of soft rain on the leaves of the fig-tree
at the window, and the chirping of a little bird, to tell another
there was shelter under them, brought me repose and slumber.
Scarcely had I closed my eyes, if indeed time can be reckoned
any more in sleep than in heaven, when my Fiametta seemed to
have led me into the meadow. You will see it below you: turn
away that branch: gently! gently! do not break it; for the little
bird sat there.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> I think, Giovanni, I can divine the place. Although
this fig-tree, growing out of the wall between the cellar and us,
is fantastic enough in its branches, yet that other which I see
yonder, bent down and forced to crawl along the grass by the
prepotency of the young shapely walnut-tree, is much more so.
It forms a seat, about a cubit above the ground, level and long
enough for several.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Ha! you fancy it must be a favourite spot with me,
because of the two strong forked stakes wherewith it is propped
and supported!</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Poets know the haunts of poets at first sight; and
he who loved Laura.... O Laura! did I say he who <i>loved</i> thee?
... hath whisperings where those feet would wander which
have been restless after Fiametta.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> It is true, my imagination has often conducted
her thither; but there in this chamber she appeared to me more
visibly in a dream.</p>

<p>&#8216;Thy prayers have been heard, O Giovanni,&#8217; said she.</p>

<p>I sprang to embrace her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do not spill the water! Ah! you have spilt a part of it.&#8217;</p>

<p>I then observed in her hand a crystal vase. A few drops
were sparkling on the sides and running down the rim: a few
were trickling from the base and from the hand that held it.</p>

<p>&#8216;I must go down to the brook,&#8217; said she, &#8216;and fill it again as
it was filled before.&#8217;</p>

<p>What a moment of agony was this to me! Could I be certain
how long might be her absence? She went: I was following:
she made a sign for me to turn back: I disobeyed her only an
instant: yet my sense of disobedience, increasing my feebleness
and confusion, made me lose sight of her. In the next moment
she was again at my side, with the cup quite full. I stood
motionless: I feared my breath might shake the water over.
I looked her in the face for her commands ... and to see it
... to see it so calm, so beneficent, so beautiful. I was forgetting
what I had prayed for, when she lowered her head,
tasted of the cup, and gave it me. I drank; and suddenly
sprang forth before me many groves and palaces and gardens,
and their statues and their avenues, and their labyrinths of
alaternus and bay, and alcoves of citron, and watchful loopholes
in the retirements of impenetrable pomegranate. Farther off,
just below where the fountain slipped away from its marble
hall and guardian gods, arose, from their beds of moss and
drosera and darkest grass, the sisterhood of oleanders, fond
of tantalizing with their bosomed flowers and their moist and
pouting blossoms the little shy rivulet, and of covering its face
with all the colours of the dawn. My dream expanded and
moved forward. I trod again the dust of Posilipo, soft as the
feathers in the wings of Sleep. I emerged on Baia; I crossed
her innumerable arches; I loitered in the breezy sunshine of her
mole; I trusted the faithful seclusion of her caverns, the keepers
of so many secrets; and I reposed on the buoyancy of her tepid
sea. Then Naples, and her theatres and her churches, and
grottoes and dells and forts and promontories, rushed forward
in confusion, now among soft whispers, now among sweetest
sounds, and subsided, and sank, and disappeared. Yet a
memory seemed to come fresh from every one: each had time
enough for its tale, for its pleasure, for its reflection, for its pang.
As I mounted with silent steps the narrow staircase of the old
palace, how distinctly did I feel against the palm of my hand
the coldness of that smooth stone-work, and the greater of the
cramps of iron in it!</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah me! is this forgetting?&#8217; cried I anxiously to Fiametta.</p>

<p>&#8216;We must recall these scenes before us,&#8217; she replied: &#8216;such is
the punishment of them. Let us hope and believe that the
apparition, and the compunction which must follow it, will be
accepted as the full penalty, and that both will pass away
almost together.&#8217;</p>

<p>I feared to lose anything attendant on her presence: I feared
to approach her forehead with my lips: I feared to touch the
lily on its long wavy leaf in her hair, which filled my whole heart
with fragrance. Venerating, adoring, I bowed my head at
last to kiss her snow-white robe, and trembled at my presumption.
And yet the effulgence of her countenance vivified
while it chastened me. I loved her ... I must not say <i>more</i>
than ever ... <i>better</i> than ever; it was Fiametta who had
inhabited the skies. As my hand opened toward her:</p>

<p>&#8216;Beware!&#8217; said she, faintly smiling; &#8216;beware, Giovanni!
Take only the crystal; take it, and drink again.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Must all be then forgotten?&#8217; said I sorrowfully.</p>

<p>&#8216;Remember your prayer and mine, Giovanni. Shall both
have been granted ... oh, how much worse than in vain?&#8217;</p>

<p>I drank instantly; I drank largely. How cool my bosom
grew; how could it grow so cool before her! But it was not to
remain in its quiescency; its trials were not yet over. I will
not, Francesco! no, I may not commemorate the incidents she
related to me, nor which of us said, &#8216;I blush for having loved
<i>first</i>;&#8217; nor which of us replied, &#8216;Say <i>least</i>, say <i>least</i>, and blush
again.&#8217;</p>

<p>The charm of the words (for I felt not the encumbrance of
the body nor the acuteness of the spirit) seemed to possess me
wholly. Although the water gave me strength and comfort,
and somewhat of celestial pleasure, many tears fell around the
border of the vase as she held it up before me, exhorting me to
take courage, and inviting me with more than exhortation to
accomplish my deliverance. She came nearer, more tenderly,
more earnestly; she held the dewy globe with both hands, leaning
forward, and sighed and shook her head, drooping at my
pusillanimity. It was only when a ringlet had touched the rim,
and perhaps the water (for a sunbeam on the surface could
never have given it such a golden hue), that I took courage,
clasped it, and exhausted it. Sweet as was the water, sweet
as was the serenity it gave me ... alas! that also which it
moved away from me was sweet!</p>

<p>&#8216;This time you can trust me alone,&#8217; said she, and parted
my hair, and kissed my brow. Again she went toward the brook:
again my agitation, my weakness, my doubt, came over me:
nor could I see her while she raised the water, nor knew I whence
she drew it. When she returned, she was close to me at once:
she smiled: her smile pierced me to the bones: it seemed an
angel&#8217;s. She sprinkled the pure water on me; she looked most
fondly; she took my hand; she suffered me to press hers to my
bosom; but, whether by design I cannot tell, she let fall a few
drops of the chilly element between.</p>

<p>&#8216;And now, O my beloved!&#8217; said she, &#8216;we have consigned to
the bosom of God our earthly joys and sorrows. The joys cannot
return, let not the sorrows. These alone would trouble my
repose among the blessed.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Trouble thy repose! Fiametta! Give me the chalice!&#8217;
cried I ... &#8216;not a drop will I leave in it, not a drop.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Take it!&#8217; said that soft voice. &#8216;O now most dear Giovanni!
I know thou hast strength enough; and there is but little ...
at the bottom lies our first kiss.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Mine! didst thou say, beloved one? and is that left thee still?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>Mine</i>,&#8217; said she, pensively; and as she abased her head, the
broad leaf of the lily hid her brow and her eyes; the light of
heaven shone through the flower.</p>

<p>&#8216;O Fiametta! Fiametta!&#8217; cried I in agony, &#8216;God is the God
of mercy, God is the God of love ... can I, can I ever?&#8217; I
struck the chalice against my head, unmindful that I held it;
the water covered my face and my feet. I started up, not yet
awake, and I heard the name of Fiametta in the curtains.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Love, O Giovanni, and life itself, are but dreams
at best. I do think</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Never so gloriously was Sleep attended</span><br />
<span class="i0">As with the pageant of that heavenly maid.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p>But to dwell on such subjects is sinful. The recollection of
them, with all their vanities, brings tears into my eyes.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> And into mine too ... they were so very
charming.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Alas, alas! the time always comes when we must
regret the enjoyments of our youth.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> If we have let them pass us.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> I mean our indulgence in them.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Francesco! I think you must remember Raffaellino
degli Alfani.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Was it Raffaellino who lived near San Michele in
Orto?</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> The same. He was an innocent soul, and fond of
fish. But whenever his friend Sabbatelli sent him a trout from
Pratolino, he always kept it until next day or the day after,
just long enough to render it unpalatable. He then turned it
over in the platter, smelt at it closer, although the news of its
condition came undeniably from a distance, touched it with his
forefinger, solicited a testimony from the gills which the eyes had
contradicted, sighed over it, and sent it for a present to somebody
else. Were I a lover of trout as Raffaellino was, I think
I should have taken an opportunity of enjoying it while the
pink and crimson were glittering on it.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Trout, yes.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> And all other fish I could encompass.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> O thou grave mocker! I did not suspect such
slyness in thee: proof enough I had almost forgotten thee.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Listen! listen! I fancied I caught a footstep in
the passage. Come nearer; bend your head lower, that I may
whisper a word in your ear. Never let Assunta hear you sigh.
She is mischievous: she may have been standing at the door:
not that I believe she would be guilty of any such impropriety:
but who knows what girls are capable of! She has no malice,
only in laughing; and a sigh sets her windmill at work, van over
van, incessantly.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> I should soon check her. I have no notion....</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> After all, she is a good girl ... a trifle of the
wilful. She must have it that many things are hurtful to me
... reading in particular ... it makes people so odd. Tina
is a small matter of the madcap ... in her own particular
way ... but exceedingly discreet, I do assure you, if they will
only leave her alone.</p>

<p>I find I was mistaken, there was nobody.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> A cat, perhaps.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> No such thing. I order him over to Certaldo
while the birds are laying and sitting: and he knows by experience,
favourite as he is, that it is of no use to come back before
he is sent for. Since the first impetuosities of youth, he has
rarely been refractory or disobliging. We have lived together
now these five years, unless I miscalculate; and he seems to have
learnt something of my manners, wherein violence and enterprise
by no means predominate. I have watched him looking
at a large green lizard; and, their eyes being opposite and near,
he has doubted whether it might be pleasing to me if he began
the attack; and their tails on a sudden have touched one another
at the decision.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Seldom have adverse parties felt the same desire
of peace at the same moment, and none ever carried it more
simultaneously and promptly into execution.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> He enjoys his <i>otium cum dignitate</i> at Certaldo:
there he is my castellan, and his chase is unlimited in those
domains. After the doom of relegation is expired, he comes
hither at midsummer. And then if you could see his joy!
His eyes are as deep as a well, and as clear as a fountain: he
jerks his tail into the air like a royal sceptre, and waves it like
the wand of a magician. You would fancy that, as Horace
with his head, he was about to smite the stars with it. There
is ne&#8217;er such another cat in the parish; and he knows it, a rogue!
We have rare repasts together in the bean-and-bacon time,
although in regard to the bean he sides with the philosopher of
Samos; but after due examination. In cleanliness he is a very
nun; albeit in that quality which lies between cleanliness and
godliness, there is a smack of Fra Biagio about him. What
is that book in your hand?</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> My breviary.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Well, give me mine too ... there, on the little
table in the corner, under the glass of primroses. We can do
nothing better.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> What prayer were you looking for? let me find it.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> I don&#8217;t know how it is: I am scarcely at present
in a frame of mind for it. We are of one faith: the prayers of
the one will do for the other: and I am sure, if you omitted my
name, you would say them all over afresh. I wish you could
recollect in any book as dreamy a thing to entertain me as I have
been just repeating. We have had enough of Dante: I believe
few of his beauties have escaped us: and small faults, which
we readily pass by, are fitter for small folks, as grubs are the
proper bait for gudgeons.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> I have had as many dreams as most men. We
are all made up of them, as the webs of the spider are particles
of her own vitality. But how infinitely less do we profit by
them! I will relate to you, before we separate, one among the
multitude of mine, as coming the nearest to the poetry of yours,
and as having been not totally useless to me. Often have I
reflected on it; sometimes with pensiveness, with sadness never.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Then, Francesco, if you had with you as copious
a choice of dreams as clustered on the elm-trees where the
Sibyl led Aeneas, this, in preference to the whole swarm of them,
is the queen dream for me.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> When I was younger I was fond of wandering in
solitary places, and never was afraid of slumbering in woods
and grottoes. Among the chief pleasures of my life, and among
the commonest of my occupations, was the bringing before me
such heroes and heroines of antiquity, such poets and sages,
such of the prosperous and the unfortunate, as most interested
me by their courage, their wisdom, their eloquence, or their
adventures. Engaging them in the conversation best suited
to their characters, I knew perfectly their manners, their steps,
their voices: and often did I moisten with my tears the models
I had been forming of the less happy.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Great is the privilege of entering into the studies
of the intellectual; great is that of conversing with the guides of
nations, the movers of the mass, the regulators of the unruly
will, stiff, in its impurity and rust, against the finger of the
Almighty Power that formed it: but give me, Francesco, give
me rather the creature to sympathize with; apportion me the
sufferings to assuage. Ah, gentle soul! thou wilt never send
them over to another; they have better hopes from thee.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> We both alike feel the sorrows of those around us.
He who suppresses or allays them in another, breaks many
thorns off his own; and future years will never harden fresh ones.</p>

<p>My occupation was not always in making the politician talk
politics, the orator toss his torch among the populace, the
philosopher run down from philosophy to cover the retreat or
the advances of his sect; but sometimes in devising how such
characters must act and discourse, on subjects far remote from
the beaten track of their career. In like manner the philologist,
and again the dialectician, were not indulged in the review and
parade of their trained bands, but, at times, brought forward
to show in what manner and in what degree external habits
had influenced the conformation of the internal man. It was
far from unprofitable to set passing events before past actors,
and to record the decisions of those whose interests and passions
are unconcerned in them.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> This is surely no easy matter. The thoughts are
in fact your own, however you distribute them.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> All cannot be my own; if you mean by <i>thoughts</i>
the opinions and principles I should be the most desirous to
inculcate. Some favourite ones perhaps may obtrude too
prominently, but otherwise no misbehaviour is permitted them:
reprehension and rebuke are always ready, and the offence is
punished on the spot.</p>

<p><i>Boccaccio.</i> Certainly you thus throw open, to its full extent,
the range of poetry and invention; which cannot but be very
limited and sterile, unless where we find displayed much diversity
of character as disseminated by nature, much peculiarity of
sentiment as arising from position, marked with unerring skill
through every shade and gradation; and finally and chiefly,
much intertexture and intensity of passion. You thus convey
to us more largely and expeditiously the stores of your understanding
and imagination, than you ever could by sonnets or
canzonets, or sinewless and sapless allegories.</p>

<p>But weightier works are less captivating. If you had published
any such as you mention, you must have waited for their
acceptance. Not only the fame of Marcellus, but every other,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Crescit occulto velut arbor aevo;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p>and that which makes the greatest vernal shoot is apt to make
the least autumnal. Authors in general who have met celebrity
at starting, have already had their reward; always their utmost
due, and often much beyond it. We cannot hope for both
celebrity and fame: supremely fortunate are the few who are
allowed the liberty of choice between them. We two prefer
the strength that springs from exercise and toil, acquiring it
gradually and slowly: we leave to others the earlier blessing of
that sleep which follows enjoyment. How many at first sight
are enthusiastic in their favour! Of these how large a portion
come away empty-handed and discontented! like idlers who
visit the seacoast, fill their pockets with pebbles bright from the
passing wave, and carry them off with rapture. After a short
examination at home, every streak seems faint and dull, and
the whole contexture coarse, uneven, and gritty: first one is
thrown away, then another; and before the week&#8217;s end the store
is gone, of things so shining and wonderful.</p>

<p><i>Petrarca.</i> Allegory, which you named with sonnets and
canzonets, had few attractions for me, believing it to be the
delight in general of idle, frivolous, inexcursive minds, in whose
mansions there is neither hall nor portal to receive the loftier
of the Passions. A stranger to the Affections, she holds a low
station among the handmaidens of Poetry, being fit for little
but an apparition in a mask. I had reflected for some time on
this subject, when, wearied with the length of my walk over
the mountains, and finding a soft old molehill, covered with
grey grass, by the wayside, I laid my head upon it and slept.
I cannot tell how long it was before a species of dream or vision
came over me.</p>

<p>Two beautiful youths appeared beside me; each was winged;
but the wings were hanging down, and seemed ill adapted to
flight. One of them, whose voice was the softest I ever heard,
looking at me frequently, said to the other:</p>

<p>&#8216;He is under my guardianship for the present: do not awaken
him with that feather.&#8217;</p>

<p>Methought, hearing the whisper, I saw something like the
feather on an arrow; and then the arrow itself; the whole of it,
even to the point; although he carried it in such a manner
that it was difficult at first to discover more than a palm&#8217;s length
of it: the rest of the shaft, and the whole of the barb, was behind
his ankles.</p>

<p>&#8216;This feather never awakens any one,&#8217; replied he, rather
petulantly; &#8216;but it brings more of confident security, and more
of cherished dreams, than you without me are capable of
imparting.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Be it so!&#8217; answered the gentler ... &#8216;none is less inclined to
quarrel or dispute than I am. Many whom you have wounded
grievously, call upon me for succour. But so little am I disposed
to thwart you, it is seldom I venture to do more for them than
to whisper a few words of comfort in passing. How many
reproaches on these occasions have been cast upon me for
indifference and infidelity! Nearly as many, and nearly in
the same terms, as upon you!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Odd enough that we, O Sleep! should be thought so alike,&#8217;
said Love, contemptuously. &#8216;Yonder is he who bears a nearer
resemblance to you: the dullest have observed it.&#8217; I fancied
I turned my eyes to where he was pointing, and saw at a distance
the figure he designated. Meanwhile the contention went on
uninterruptedly. Sleep was slow in asserting his power or his
benefits. Love recapitulated them; but only that he might
assert his own above them. Suddenly he called on me to
decide, and to choose my patron. Under the influence, first of
the one, then of the other, I sprang from repose to rapture, I
alighted from rapture on repose ... and knew not which
was sweetest. Love was very angry with me, and declared
he would cross me throughout the whole of my existence.
Whatever I might on other occasions have thought of his
veracity, I now felt too surely the conviction that he would
keep his word. At last, before the close of the altercation, the
third Genius had advanced, and stood near us. I cannot tell
how I knew him, but I knew him to be the Genius of Death.
Breathless as I was at beholding him, I soon became familiar
with his features. First they seemed only calm; presently
they grew contemplative; and lastly beautiful: those of the
Graces themselves are less regular, less harmonious, less composed.
Love glanced at him unsteadily, with a countenance
in which there was somewhat of anxiety, somewhat of disdain;
and cried: &#8216;Go away! go away! nothing that thou touchest,
lives.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Say rather, child!&#8217; replied the advancing form, and advancing
grew loftier and statelier, &#8216;say rather that nothing of beautiful
or of glorious lives its own true life until my wing hath passed
over it.&#8217;</p>

<p>Love pouted, and rumpled and bent down with his forefinger
the stiff short feathers on his arrow-head; but replied not.
Although he frowned worse than ever, and at me, I dreaded him
less and less, and scarcely looked toward him. The milder and
calmer Genius, the third, in proportion as I took courage to
contemplate him, regarded me with more and more complacency.
He held neither flower nor arrow, as the others did; but, throwing
back the clusters of dark curls that overshadowed his
countenance, he presented to me his hand, openly and benignly.
I shrank on looking at him so near, and yet I sighed to love him.
He smiled, not without an expression of pity, at perceiving my
diffidence, my timidity: for I remembered how soft was the
hand of Sleep, how warm and entrancing was Love&#8217;s. By
degrees, I became ashamed of my ingratitude; and turning my
face away, I held out my arms, and felt my neck within his.
Composure strewed and allayed all the throbbings of my bosom;
the coolness of freshest morning breathed around: the heavens
seemed to open above me; while the beautiful cheek of my
deliverer rested on my head. I would now have looked for
those others; but knowing my intention by my gesture, he
said, consolatorily:</p>

<p>&#8216;Sleep is on his way to the Earth, where many are calling
him; but it is not to these he hastens; for every call only makes
him fly farther off. Sedately and gravely as he looks, he is
nearly as capricious and volatile as the more arrogant and
ferocious one.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And Love!&#8217; said I, &#8216;whither is he departed? If not too late,
I would propitiate and appease him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He who cannot follow me, he who cannot overtake and pass
me,&#8217; said the Genius, &#8216;is unworthy of the name, the most glorious
in earth or heaven. Look up! Love is yonder, and ready to
receive thee.&#8217;</p>

<p>I looked: the earth was under me: I saw only the clear blue
sky, and something brighter above it.</p>

<span class="i0">Here, where precipitate Spring, with one light bound</span><br />
<span class="i0">Into hot Summer&#8217;s lusty arms, expires,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And where go forth at morn, at eve, at night,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Soft airs that want the lute to play with &#8217;em,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And softer sighs that know not what they want,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Aside a wall, beneath an orange-tree,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Whose tallest flowers could tell the lowlier ones</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of sights in Fiesole right up above,</span><br />
<span class="i0">While I was gazing a few paces off</span><br />
<span class="i0">At what they seem&#8217;d to show me with their nods,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Their frequent whispers and their pointing shoots,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A gentle maid came down the garden-steps</span><br />
<span class="i0">And gathered the pure treasure in her lap.</span><br />
<span class="i0">I heard the branches rustle, and stept forth</span><br />
<span class="i0">To drive the ox away, or mule, or goat,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Such I believed it must be. How could I</span><br />
<span class="i0">Let beast o&#8217;erpower them? When hath wind or rain</span><br />
<span class="i0">Borne hard upon weak plant that wanted me,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And I (however they might bluster round)</span><br />
<span class="i0">Walkt off? &#8217;Twere most ungrateful: for sweet scents</span><br />
<span class="i0">Are the swift vehicles of still sweeter thoughts,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And nurse and pillow the dull memory</span><br />
<span class="i0">That would let drop without them her best stores.</span><br />
<span class="i0">They bring me tales of youth and tones of love,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And &#8217;tis and ever was my wish and way</span><br />
<span class="i0">To let all flowers live freely, and all die</span><br />
<span class="i0">(Whene&#8217;er their Genius bids their souls depart)</span><br />
<span class="i0">Among their kindred in their native place.</span><br />
<span class="i0">I never pluck the rose; the violet&#8217;s head</span><br />
<span class="i0">Hath shaken with my breath upon its bank</span><br />
<span class="i0">And not reproacht me; the ever-sacred cup</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of the pure lily hath between my hands</span><br />
<span class="i0">Felt safe, unsoil&#8217;d, nor lost one grain of gold.</span><br />
<span class="i0">I saw the light that made the glossy leaves</span><br />
<span class="i0">More glossy; the fair arm, the fairer cheek</span><br />
<span class="i0">Warmed by the eye intent on its pursuit;</span><br />
<span class="i0">I saw the foot that, although half-erect</span><br />
<span class="i0">From its grey slipper, could not lift her up</span><br />
<span class="i0">To what she wanted: I held down a branch</span><br />
<span class="i0">And gather&#8217;d her some blossoms; since their hour</span><br />
<span class="i0">Was come, and bees had wounded them, and flies</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of harder wing were working their way thro&#8217;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And scattering them in fragments under-foot.</span><br />
<span class="i0">So crisp were some, they rattled unevolved,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Others, ere broken off, fell into shells,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For such appear the petals when detacht,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Unbending, brittle, lucid, white like snow,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And like snow not seen thro&#8217;, by eye or sun:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Yet every one her gown received from me</span><br />
<span class="i0">Was fairer than the first. I thought not so,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But so she praised them to reward my care.</span><br />
<span class="i0">I said, &#8216;You find the largest.&#8217;</span><br />
<span class="i10">&#8216;This indeed,&#8217;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Cried she, &#8216;is large and sweet.&#8217; She held one forth,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Whether for me to look at or to stake</span><br />
<span class="i0">She knew not, nor did I; but taking it</span><br />
<span class="i0">Would best have solved (and this she felt) her doubt.</span><br />
<span class="i0">I dared not touch it; for it seemed a part</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of her own self; fresh, full, the most mature</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of blossoms, yet a blossom; with a touch</span><br />
<span class="i0">To fall, and yet unfallen. She drew back</span><br />
<span class="i0">The boon she tender&#8217;d, and then, finding not</span><br />
<span class="i0">The ribbon at her waist to fix it in,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Dropt it, as loath to drop it, on the rest.</span><br />

<span class="i0">The Rhine, nor over Tyrol wend:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thus all at once shall rise more grand</span><br />

<span class="i1">Dickens! how often, when the air</span><br />

<span class="i0">And rais&#8217;d to heaven my thankful eyes</span><br />

<span class="i0">Deputed on the banks of Thames</span><br />
<span class="i0">To speak his voice and urge his claims.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Let every nation know from thee</span><br />
<span class="i0">How less than lovely Italy</span><br />
<span class="i0">Is the whole world beside; let all</span><br />
<span class="i0">Into their grateful breasts recall</span><br />
<span class="i0">How Prospero and Miranda dwelt</span><br />
<span class="i0">In Italy: the griefs that melt</span><br />
<span class="i0">The stoniest heart, each sacred tear</span><br />
<span class="i0">One lacrymatory gathered here;</span><br />
<span class="i0">All Desdemona&#8217;s, all that fell</span><br />
<span class="i0">In playful Juliet&#8217;s bridal cell.</span><br />
<span class="i1">Ah! could my steps in life&#8217;s decline</span><br />
<span class="i0">Accompany or follow thine!</span><br />
<span class="i0">But my own vines are not for me</span><br />
<span class="i0">To prune, or from afar to see.</span><br />
<span class="i0">I miss the tales I used to tell</span><br />
<span class="i0">With cordial Hare and joyous Gell,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And that good old Archbishop whose</span><br />
<span class="i0">Cool library, at evening&#8217;s close</span><br />
<span class="i0">(Soon as from Ischia swept the gale</span><br />
<span class="i0">And heav&#8217;d and left the dark&#8217;ning sail),</span><br />
<span class="i0">Its lofty portal open&#8217;d wide</span><br />
<span class="i0">To me, and very few beside:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Yet large his kindness. Still the poor</span><br />
<span class="i0">Flock round Taranto&#8217;s palace door,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And find no other to replace</span><br />
<span class="i0">The noblest of a noble race.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Amid our converse you would see</span><br />
<span class="i0">Each with white cat upon his knee,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And flattering that grand company:</span><br />
<span class="i0">For Persian kings might proudly own</span><br />
<span class="i0">Such glorious cats to share the throne.</span><br />
<span class="i1">Write me few letters: I&#8217;m content</span><br />
<span class="i0">With what for all the world is meant;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Write then for all: but, since my breast</span><br />
<span class="i0">Is far more faithful than the rest,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Never shall any other share</span><br />
<span class="i0">With little Nelly nestling there.</span><br />

<span class="i0">Barry! your spirit long ago</span><br />
<span class="i0">Has haunted me; at last I know</span><br />
<span class="i0">The heart it sprung from: one more sound</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ne&#8217;er rested on poetic ground.</span><br />
<span class="i0">But, Barry Cornwall! by what right</span><br />
<span class="i0">Wring you my breast and dim my sight,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And make me wish at every touch</span><br />
<span class="i0">My poor old hand could do as much?</span><br />
<span class="i0">No other in these later times</span><br />
<span class="i0">Has bound me in so potent rhymes.</span><br />
<span class="i0">I have observed the curious dress</span><br />
<span class="i0">And jewelry of brave Queen Bess,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But always found some o&#8217;ercharged thing,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Some flaw in even the brightest ring,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Admiring in her men of war,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A rich but too argute guitar.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Our foremost now are more prolix,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And scrape with three-fell fiddlesticks,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And, whether bound for griefs or smiles,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Are slow to turn as crocodiles.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Once, every court and country bevy</span><br />
<span class="i0">Chose the gallant of loins less heavy,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And would have laid upon the shelf</span><br />
<span class="i0">Him who could talk but of himself.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Reason is stout, but even Reason</span><br />
<span class="i0">May walk too long in Rhyme&#8217;s hot season.</span><br />
<span class="i0">I have heard many folks aver</span><br />
<span class="i0">They have caught horrid colds with her.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Imagination&#8217;s paper kite,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Unless the string is held in tight,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Whatever fits and starts it takes,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Soon bounces on the ground, and breaks.</span><br />
<span class="i0">You, placed afar from each extreme,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Nor dully drowse nor wildly dream,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But, ever flowing with good-humour,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Are bright as spring and warm as summer.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Mid your Penates not a word</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of scorn or ill-report is heard;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Nor is there any need to pull</span><br />
<span class="i0">A sheaf or truss from cart too full,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lest it o&#8217;erload the horse, no doubt,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Or clog the road by falling out.</span><br />
<span class="i0">We, who surround a common table,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And imitate the fashionable,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Wear each two eyeglasses: <i>this</i> lens</span><br />
<span class="i0">Shows us our faults, <i>that</i> other men&#8217;s.</span><br />
<span class="i0">We do not care how dim may be</span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>This</i> by whose aid our own we see,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But, ever anxiously alert</span><br />
<span class="i0">That all may have their whole desert,</span><br />
<span class="i0">We would melt down the stars and sun</span><br />
<span class="i0">In our heart&#8217;s furnace, to make one</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thro&#8217; which the enlighten&#8217;d world might spy</span><br />
<span class="i0">A mote upon a brother&#8217;s eye.</span><br />
